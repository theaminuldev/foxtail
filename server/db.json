      "slug": "proposal-host-3rd-party-blocks-in-gutenbergs-github-repository",
      "content": "\n<p>Matias Ventura, Gutenberg’s Lead Architect, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58773\">recently made a pitch</a> to incorporate some 3rd-party blocks in the Gutenberg GitHub repository:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“There&#8217;s a growing subset of blocks that we may contemplate creating that are either more niche or—for various reasons—not necessarily an immediate fit for the bundled library in core. This would include blocks that have enough appeal, demand, and where offering an endorsed implementation can significantly help both creators and viewers given best practices can be ascertained.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>These plugins won’t just be guests—they’ll become roommates, proudly featured in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-directory/\">Blocks Directory</a>: “designed, developed, published, and maintained by core contributors in this repository” but available to install as standalone blocks in the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"896\" height=\"503\" data-attachment-id=\"95958\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/version-1-prototype-of-the-wordpress-admin-block-directory-announced/block-directory\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory.png\" data-orig-size=\"896,503\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"block-directory\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-300x168.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-500x281.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95958\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory.png 896w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-300x168.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-768x431.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-500x281.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-178x100.png 178w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/block-directory-640x360.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/block-directory/\">Early design prototypes</a> of the Block Directory</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tension between users’ demand to bundle more functionalities and the maintainers’ inclination toward keeping core as lean as possible won’t be resolved anytime soon. Yet this presents an interesting compromise: if <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog\">the estimations</a> are accurate, and most websites are built with a combo of Group blocks holding Heading, Paragraph, Image, List, and Button blocks, then having this living arrangement will benefit both segments of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The History of the Block Directory</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Directory features a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/block/\">subset of single-purpose plugins</a> that users can install right in the editor without leaving the page you’re working on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Included <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-5-eckstine-introduces-block-directory-block-patterns-and-automatic-updates-for-themes-and-plugins\">in the Block Editor since</a> WordPress 5.5, it has been the topic of several public debates since Matt Mullenweg prioritized it as an upcoming focus area in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-explores-proposal-for-new-block-directory-to-host-single-block-plugins\">reported on WP Tavern</a>, the original proposal was to host small, JavaScript-based blocks that users could easily install via searchable in-editor UI. The critical responses to the technical limitations, the divergence from the native UX, and the potential performance toll it would entail didn’t prevent the final implementation from being almost identical to the initial version (although a few <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/block-directory/\">early design prototypes</a> did address the UX issue).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Evolution of Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter where they’re hosted, Blocks are plugins. And plugin developers are the jelly in WordPress’ sandwich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treating these smaller-scoped blocks as standard plugins that must adhere to the platform’s Plugin guidelines regarding monetization, along with the introduction of a set of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2020/07/11/you-can-now-add-your-own-plugins-to-the-block-directory/\">technical restrictions</a>—no Dynamic Blocks, no block extensions, preferably no block collections, and no style Variations—has left many frustrated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/revised-block-directory-guidelines-proposal-updates-wording-but-changes-little-else\">technical and business-related</a> concerns raised during the discussions on the initial proposal remain unresolved in this latest proposal. Still, it does offer a modest promise to share the burden of maintenance and updates and the benefits of the authored <em>by WordPress.org</em> stamp of approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, though, the questions aren’t so much the technical functionality, the UI, or the business aspects; Ventura’s exploratory proposal is an administrative reform, hinting at the evolution of Gutenberg: no longer an experimental add-on that ships an ever-expanding array of specialized blocks but a maturate platform that focuses on fundamental core blocks, treating the former as cherished friends who are welcome to stay over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples mentioned in the proposal</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/abbreviation-button-for-the-block-editor/\">Abbreviation Button for the Block Editor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/copyright-block\">Copyright Block</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-catalog\">Block Catalog</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility\">Block Visibility</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block\">Icon Block</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/lang-attribute\">Lang Attribute for the Block Editor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/markdown-comment-block/\">Markdown Comment Block</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-sharing-block/\">Social Sharing Block</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/superlist-block\">Superlist Block</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/todo-block\">Todo Block</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

It features a new Product Details block style, six new layouts for the Product Collection block, and a sales column for marketing analytics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers, it offers improved logging, a notice on Legacy REST API removal, simplified customer history calculation, and 8.6.1 patching four issues. </p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>After a slight delay, <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/02/15/woocommerce-8-6-product-blocks-order-attribution-updates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce 8.6 was released</a> last week. An Order Attribution Tracking issue discovered in 8.5.2 <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/02/13/woocommerce-8-6-0-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prompted the delay</a> so that a fix could be included in the 8.6 release. With 365 commits from 73 contributors, this latest version of WooCommerce introduces some slick new features and enhancements for merchants and developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"206\" data-attachment-id=\"154233\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-releases-8-6-8-6-1/block-styles-section\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section.png\" data-orig-size=\"556,206\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"block-styles-section\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section-300x111.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section-500x185.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section.png\" alt=\"Product Details Block Styles Section\" class=\"wp-image-154233\" style=\"width:369px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section.png 556w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section-300x111.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section-500x185.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Block Style for Product Details Block</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce 8.6 introduces a new ‘Styles’ area for the Product Details block with two options; Classic and Minimal. By default the Minimal style is selected on new installs with the Classic style being maintained to ensure compatibility with theme-based CSS customizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Product Collection Block Gains Six New Layouts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the most impactful feature for merchants and marketers is the introduction of six new layouts for the Product Collection block. Now merchants can select between New Arrivals, Top Rated, Best Selling, On Sale, Featured and Product Catalog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1506\" height=\"1240\" data-attachment-id=\"154234\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-releases-8-6-8-6-1/product-collection-layouts\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts.png\" data-orig-size=\"1506,1240\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"product-collection-layouts\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts-300x247.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts-500x412.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Product Collection Layouts Interface.\" class=\"wp-image-154234\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts.png 1506w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts-300x247.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts-500x412.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts-768x632.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1506px) 100vw, 1506px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>These new layouts can be combined, mixed and matched on a single page to respond better to the needs of merchants. For example, promote your new spring arrivals in a block above your winter sale items that leads into your complete product catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sales Column Added to Marketing Page</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For merchants who are using WooCommerce to view and manage their marketing channels (i.e. Google Ad campaigns), a new column in the Sales card provides a quick look at how various campaigns are performing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developer Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Logging System Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significant improvements have been made to the internal logging system in WooCommerce 8.6. Merchants and developers now have an interface for browsing and viewing log entries that will improve debugging and auditing in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a log file browser that lets users filter, sort and manage log files. Users can now click individual log files and view them right within their WordPress dashboard. Search has also been improved to enable selecting a group of files to search within, filtering, sorting and linking individual lines in files that contain the search term. Logs have also now been made fully exportable. Users can download individual files or in bulk via a zip file.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Legacy REST API Removal Notice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WooCommerce prepares for the removal of its legacy REST API in 9.0, merchants still using the legacy API will now see a notice of the upcoming change. Given the pace of releases, this means deprecation/removal is about 4 months away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simplified Customer History Calculation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Order Attribution Tracking the main cause for the delay in releasing 8.6, a simplified customer history calculation was introduced to mitigate the risk of a calculation resulting in 500 errors (server errors) on larger shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8.6.1 Release Patches 4 Issues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A patch was released earlier this week that fixes four issues identified with the release of 8.6. These issues were significant enough that this release was issued very quickly. Check out the details on the <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/02/20/woocommerce-8-6-1-fixes-to-issues-introduced-in-8-6-0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce Developer blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">w00t Dev Docs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ronny Shani</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before the release, the team <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/01/31/introducing-new-woocommerce-developer-documentation/\"><strong>launched a brand new</strong></a> documentation website for developers. The <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/docs/\"><strong>Woo Developer Docs</strong></a> embraces the docs-as-code approach, hosting markdown files in a centralized location: <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/trunk/docs\"><strong>the docs folder of the project’s GitHub monorepo</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is a win-win:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>It encourages community collaboration and empowers users to contribute to the documentation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It enables the plugin’s developers to update docs whenever they modify or update WooCommerce’s codebase.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/roadmap/improving-docs/\"><strong>Improving the developer experience</strong></a> is part of Woo’s roadmap; V1 is a great example of how to do it right.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Progress On New Product Editor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a small tweak to the new Product Editor was introduced, adding the ability to mark a product as Featured. Merchants using the new Product Editor can click an inline star icon in the title field. The new product editor is making steady progress as it reshapes the way merchants interact with WooCommerce in the product creation flow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have not yet, now is a good time to give the new Product Editor a test drive to see what’s coming and how the interface of WooCommerce is changing.</p>\n",

      "slug": "navigating-the-nexus-a-chronicle-of-recent-wordpress-acquisitions",
      "content": "\n<p>Over the past four months, some exciting developments have been bustling in the dynamic mergers and acquisitions arena of WordPress. To catch everyone up let&#8217;s grab a beverage of choice and take a stroll down the calendar of memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, on February 15th, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/optinmonster-acquires-beacon-lead-magnet-creator\">OptinMonster announced</a> its acquisition of Beacon Lead Magnet Creator. Per the press release from OptinMonster &#8220;Beacon makes it easy for anyone to create and deliver professional lead magnets, without needing a writer, graphic designer or developer.&#8221; This move adds another layer to OptinMonster&#8217;s robust toolkit, reinforcing its position as a go-to resource for businesses seeking to optimize their lead-generation strategies. Additionally, the founders of <a href=\"https://beacon.by/\">Beacon.by</a>, brothers Kevin &amp; Eion McGrath will be moving on to other ventures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepping back two weeks lands us on the date of January 28th when Andrew Wilder at <a href=\"http://nerdpress.net\">NerdPress.net</a> shared the news that they acquired the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rvg-optimize-database/\">Optimize Database After Deleting Revisions Plugin</a>. As Andrew states. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tool we&#8217;ve long relied on &#8212; installing it on all our clients&#8217; sites&#8230;.and less than a day after releasing our first update (patching minor security vulnerabilities), the plugin has already been downloaded nearly 23,000 times&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolling back the calendar yet another seven weeks we see the calendar shows the date of December 6, 2023, and we once again hear from Andrew Wilder of NerdPress.net. This time the news is a bit more celebratory as it&#8217;s about their first acquisition ever! They acquired the social media sharing plugin <a href=\"https://www.nerdpress.net/announcing-hubbub/\">Grow Social from Mediavine</a>. Part of the agreement in the acquisition was to rename the plugin to clear up any confusion between Mediavines properties &#8220;Grow Social&#8221; and &#8220;Grow&#8221;, which they have by rebranding the plugin <a href=\"https://morehubbub.com/\">Hubbub</a>. Kudos to Andrew and NerdPress for consistently expanding their offerings and enriching the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, our trip down memory lane comes to a stop two months earlier on Oct 5, 2023, when Jamie Madden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcwhatwhat/status/1710102476396122397\">announced</a> on X/Twitter that his plugin <a href=\"https://licenseserver.io/\">License Server</a> plugin was acquired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peter_4sure\">@peter_4sure</a> via <a href=\"https://acquire.com/\">acquiredotcom</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the WordPress world keeps spinning on its axis of innovation, it seems our beloved industry is playing matchmaker, setting up mergers and acquisitions like they’re going out of style. It’s like watching a rom-com where everyone ends up happily ever after, except here, the happy couples are plugins, platforms, and services tying the knot. So, raise your virtual glasses to the lovebirds&#8230; here’s to them finding their soulmates in the vast sea of code and content. May these digital unions spark a renaissance in our WordPress universe, bringing us new features, faster sites, and maybe, just maybe, fewer “Error establishing a database connection”</p>\n",

Ask, and you shall receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Performance and Accessibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/02/wordpress-6-5-beta-1/\">the announcement post</a>, the upcoming version “contains more than 110 performance-related updates”, including <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">improved loading speeds</a> across the Post and Site Editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>WP 6.4</th><th>WP 6.5</th><th>Speed<br>Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Typing</td><td>60ms</td><td>15ms</td><td>4x</td></tr><tr><td>First block load</td><td>20s</td><td>8.4s</td><td>&gt; 2x</td></tr><tr><td>Patterns load</td><td>2s</td><td>1.5s</td><td>1.33x</td></tr><tr><td>Site editor first block load</td><td>7s</td><td>4.6s</td><td>1.5x</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\"><em>merging Performant Translations into Core</em></a><em>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As an open-source software whose mission is to democratize publishing, WordPress adopted a set of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/\">Accessibility Coding Standards</a>. These apply to the project’s core and official plugins, complemented by its long-term goal of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/accessibility/\">achieving Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 compliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deliver on this promise, version 6.5 ships with over 65 accessibility improvements, including “fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design and Customization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you can never have too much of a good thing, 6.5 comes packed with design, UI, and UX:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Background images in Group blocks get <code>backgroundSize</code> and <code>backgroundRepeat</code>&nbsp; support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Cover block gets <code>aspectRatio</code> support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Column, Columns, Image, and Button blocks get box-shadow support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rename blocks in List View. The name will appear as metadata. For example, <code>&lt;!-- wp:paragraph {\"metadata\":{\"name\":\"p2\"}} --&gt;</code>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overriding default right-click behavior to allow custom WordPress contextual menus.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Better drag-and-drop experience—in List View and throughout the Editor</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/pattern-overrides-an-early-review/\">Synced Patterns override</a> (formerly Reusable Blocks) for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aLngyrXuVc\">New Meta Views</a> in the Site Editor, supporting Grid layouts, sorting, and smart filters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Better Revisions</a> in the Site Editor’s Styles and Style Book sidebar.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aLngyrXuVc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Editor Triage Co-Lead <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> demonstrates the new Meta Views in WordPress 6.5</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shiny New Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you clicked the Synced Patterns link above and visited the Gutenberg Times, you might have spotted the word bindings popping up <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/pattern-overrides-an-early-review/#a-look-behind-the-scene-of-the-pattern-block-markup\">at the end of Birgit Pauli-Haack’s post</a>. An obvious segue into one of the most transformative features of 6.5: the Block Bindings API.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Block Bindings API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic’s Mario Santos <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">described the goal</a> of the new API:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;<em>This API aims to connect block attributes to values, obtained from different sources, that might vary depending on the context. For example, a value like post_author that changes depending on the current post.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This will expand the capabilities of existing blocks […] For example, having a Heading block with the content of the Post Author without needing a new Post Author block.</em>&#8220;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The API already powers the Synced Patterns and the much-anticipated ability to connect custom fields to block attributes. The list of supported blocks and attributes is short, but that’s only the beginning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paragraph:</strong> content</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heading:</strong> content</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Image:</strong> URL, alt, title</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Button: </strong>text, URL, linkTarget, rel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom fields have been neglected in the Block Editor, hidden behind the Preferences window like a lost treasure. Let’s hope this is the first sign of their comeback. If you’re interested in what you can build with this powerful combo, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/02/20/introducing-block-bindings-part-1-connecting-custom-fields/\">check out Justin Tadlock’s tutorial</a> on the WordPress Developer Blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next on the <em>finally</em> list is the Font Library, aka the WordPress font manager.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, you won’t need to write any code or install any plugins—from now on, you can do it yourself, regardless of your active theme. The fonts are stored under /wp-content/fonts which makes it as theme-agnostic as the Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1500\" height=\"991\" data-attachment-id=\"154203\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-5-is-around-the-corner-test-beta-2/font-library-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library.png\" data-orig-size=\"1500,991\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Font-Library\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library-300x198.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library-500x330.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the new Font Library (WP 6.5 Beta 2)\" class=\"wp-image-154203\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library.png 1500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library-300x198.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library-500x330.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library-768x507.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To access the Library, open the Styles sidebar, click on Typography, and click the icon next to FONTS. Try to upload, install from Google Fonts, activate, and, well, manage your fonts. Once installed, use it across the Editor, wherever the blocks’ Typography attribute is enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers can access the Font Library programmatically, create custom Font Collections for their users, or disable it altogether. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54477\">Take a peak at the still-WIP documentation</a> for instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The grand finale of this impressive lineup is the Interactivity API. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interactivity-api-prepares-for-its-official-debut-in-wordpress-6-5\">James Giroux covered it here on the Tavern</a> earlier this week, so we’ll only give you a taste of <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">WP Movies Demo</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Interactivity-API-Demo-WP-Movies.mp4\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A walkthrough of <strong>WP Movies</strong>, a demo project that features the Interactivity API (<a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wp-movies-demo\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a developer interested in the nitty-gritty details and want to try what’s already possible, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wp-movies-demo\">WP Movies GitHub repository</a>, where you’ll find a getting started tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-tavern-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That Playground link is tempting, so go experiment, and then come back to tell us which feature you’re most excited about.

Back in November, the Tavern’s last standing writer, Sarah Gooding joined her predecessors Jeff Chandler and Justin Tadlock in announcing her departure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg later put the call out for those interested in becoming full-time writers. Hundreds applied and from that list, earlier this February, seven were chosen to participate in a public trial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>Each travelled by train to a meeting where they were introduced to each other and then dropped into the middle of an arena with the only rule being to survive.</s></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel a bit like the Hunger Games have come to WordPress. But, behind the scenes, it&#8217;s a ton of enthusiasm and collaboration. After all, it&#8217;s for a platform and community we are all passionate about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hitting publish is stressful (at least for me), but, we’re excited about this chance. We&#8217;re eager to bring our unique views to Tavern readers and the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each person in the trial has two weeks with full access to the Tavern to create content. The trial contributors have not been given any restrictions on how much content they can contribute, the format of that content, or the subject matter of the content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Hunger Games, we’re each other’s biggest fans and supporters as we go through this process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The availability of trial contributors varies so for about a month, each of the seven will have staggered start dates. You’ll see content from each appear over time as they begin their trials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So what’s it like day-to-day to run the Tavern?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s everything you would imagine an industry journal would have. We’re collaborating in a private Slack channel, sharing ideas and figuring out how to create the content we’re passionate about. Early on the crew self-organized around a content calendar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re sharing article drafts for feedback from each other. Giving way to each other when we have similar ideas for articles. Challenging ideas and pushing each other to be better. All to create the best experience for Tavern readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re still figuring things out. For example, we need to find the right images to use. We also need to reconnect the X/Twitter account so articles are broadcast from it. And, we need to clean up comments on existing articles. The day-to-day things that keep the Tavern humming along.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>We’re keen to engage with Tavern readers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts on what we’re creating. All of us are in the Make WordPress Slack so feel free to ping us with your thoughts and feedback. We’re keen to grow and improve throughout this process so if a story resonates with you (or not) we’d love to hear about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a unique season for the Tavern. While eventually there will only be two primary voices, for now, there are seven. Seven different perspectives and lived experiences shaped by WordPress. Enjoy it, get stuck in and tell us what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t all gone public yet but as our content hits the Tavern’s pages, say hi, tell us <strong>your</strong> story and help us share the awesomeness of WordPress with others.</p>\n",

These figures represent a steady rise in the adoption of the Block editor. However, this year, 12.3% of respondents chose the <em>Other</em> category (likely referring to site builders).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As to their <strong>satisfaction</strong> with the Site Editor, 45.1% said it meets their needs for building websites.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>51.7% built websites for others, and 41.9% created a plugin, theme, style variation, or a block pattern.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some activities that saw a significant increase include consuming <strong>learning</strong> materials on <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org</a> and various types of <strong>contributions</strong> and involvement with the community: participated in a meetup/WordCamp, contributed to the platform, and joined the Making WordPress Slack.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seeing as most responders develop, design, or maintain WordPress websites, it’s good to see that 61.1% say they are <strong>familiar</strong> with Block-based themes and plugins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63.3% think <em>WordPress is as good as, or better than, other site builders and CMSs</em>, down from 68% in 2022. Interestingly, many also regularly use <strong>other</strong> blogging and newsletter tools to publish content, mainly Medium, Tumblr, and Blogger. The top reasons respondents preferred WordPress were open-source, familiarity, maturity, and cost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The figures above correspond with answers to the question, <em>What&#8217;s the best thing about WordPress?</em>  where <strong>performance, scalability, and accessibility</strong> registered a huge spike while parameters like ease of use, flexibility, cost, and block themes dropped significantly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ranking “essential plugins” out of the 20 most popular ones provides a glimpse into day-to-day use: Yoast SEO, Classic Editor, and WooCommerce were the top three, with <em>None of the above</em> coming fifth, Elementor Website Builder coming at 8th, and two plugins that enable post and page <strong>duplication</strong> closing the list. Gutenberg is absent.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the other hand, too many plugins were the primary cause of <strong>frustration</strong> (133% rise from 2022, with too many themes seeing a 72% rise), followed by dissatisfactory site editing, designing, configuring, and publishing experience. The cost complaints, meanwhile, are directed at <strong>hosting</strong> companies: 7% in 2023 vs. 3% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>57.5% see phases 3 and 4 of the WordPress roadmap as beneficial for developers, creators, and publishers alike, with the rest either neutral or disagreeing. Performance, security, and developer resources were the top three areas responders wanted the project to focus on, with <strong>collaborative editing</strong> at the very bottom of the list.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finally, many had <strong>poor experiences</strong> when contributing to the community, with fewer people feeling welcome to participate in various ways. Asked <em>what prevents you from contributing more</em>, 35.3% cited bad experiences and not feeling safe, welcome, or appreciated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mapping the Road Ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading through the results, one can’t help but notice a certain disconnect between the people who use WordPress and those tasked with maintaining and leading it into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responders appear less interested in new features than they are in optimizing core functionality and delivering a stable experience; many still find the Site Editor and blocks-based posts overwhelming, holding on to the Classic Editor plugin; and both audiences—extenders and end-users—crave guidance, training, and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"515\" data-attachment-id=\"154131\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-survey-results_site_editor\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WP-survey-results_site_editor.png\" data-orig-size=\"1200,515\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"WP-survey-results_site_editor\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WP-survey-results_site_editor-300x129.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WP-survey-results_site_editor-500x215.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WP-survey-results_site_editor.png\" alt=\"A chart showing the distribution of answers to question number 10 in the 2023 WordPress Survey, &quot;The WordPress Site Editor meets my needs for building websites&quot;.

Russian developer Maxim Dounin has made waves by announcing a new fork of the Nginx web server and caching proxy. The new fork is called <a href=\"https://freenginx.org/\"><strong>freenginx</strong></a>. This move is strategically aimed at steering clear of the corporate control wielded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F5,_Inc.\">F5</a>, the current owner of Ngnix.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading is-style-default\" style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>What is Nginx</strong>?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us who aren’t overly technical, Nginx is known for its versatility, serves as a robust web server, a reverse proxy, and offers formidable security features. It offers a broad range of applications which has made it a favorite among developers and IT professionals. The decision to fork Nginx comes as a response to concerns about corporate influence and the desire to maintain the open-source ethos that has been pivotal to its success.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>What role does Nginx play in WordPress hosting</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that approximately <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-nginx\">34.1% of websites</a> rely on Nginx servers, this fork has potential repercussions, especially in the enterprise space and for those involved in hosting reselling. The future landscape of Nginx will undoubtedly be closely monitored, as the developments in this space could have a cascading impact on the digital infrastructure that supports a significant portion of the internet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In speaking with some of my contacts at a variety of WordPress hosting companies, the overall sentiment was both a wait-and-see approach along with some light concern and trepidation. One contact responded with, “If the fork takes and diverges it could make Nginx support a little harder.” Another added, “It will be interesting to see what happens and how the licensing changes. I suspect a lot of commercial hosts are on the commercial version but even that could be shaken up a bit, in the long term, with this Nginx [version] has been so steady for so long though that any change will raise eyebrows.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course there is the big looming question: How might this shake things up for commercial hosts in the long run? With the usual uncertainty that comes with change, hosting providers, developers, and businesses are keeping a close eye on the outcome.&nbsp; For those working in the web hosting industry, only time will tell to see what happens with this fork in the road.&nbsp;</p>\n",

It revolutionizes site interactivity by standardizing the development of interactive elements. This makes it easier for developers and enhances user experiences. It enables dynamic interactions like shared data across blocks without reloading pages. This opens up new possibilities for developers, users and businesses alike. It could mark a significant milestone in WordPress&#8217;s evolution.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Today WordPress contributor Carlos Bravo <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/19/merge-announcement-interactivity-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">officially announced</a> the merge of the Interactivity API into Core for WordPress 6.5. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Introduced last year</a>, the team behind the Interactivity API has been releasing builds through the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gutenberg plugin</a> in preparation for this pivotal moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the Interactivity API?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the challenges with interactivity in WordPress right now is that there is no set standard in how developers can approach it. Today, developers pick their tools. They define their approach to integrating with WordPress. They decide on inter-block communication. And, they make choices (and compromises) around frontend performance for every new project they deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API aims to solve these problems. It provides developers with an opinionated approach that standardizes building interactive elements. The hope is that this will make it easier to focus on <em>what</em> to build and not <em>how</em> to build it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1084\" height=\"2048\" data-attachment-id=\"154093\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/interactivity-api-prepares-for-its-official-debut-in-wordpress-6-5/standard-graph-1084x2048\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1084,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"standard-graph-1084&#215;2048\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1-159x300.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1-265x500.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1.png\" alt=\"Visual representation of the decision areas covered by the Interactivity API, for developers.\" class=\"wp-image-154093\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1.png 1084w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1-159x300.png 159w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1-265x500.png 265w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1-768x1451.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1-813x1536.png 813w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">From the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\">original proposal </a>post on Make WordPress Core..</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does this mean for users?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the Interactivity API use a movie website in their demo where they showcase some of the functionality that users may soon be able to enjoy. In particular is the way that multiple blocks can work together to share data. In the demo, clicking a heart button on movies in a list makes a heart counter go up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this is done instantly. It doesn&#8217;t reload the page and no developer or engineering team needs to dive deeply into layers of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine building a recipe website. You want a site visitor to build their shopping list with price estimates in their local currency. The Interactivity API would facilitate being able to create all of the dynamic elements using the Block Editor. It lets a list grow and the total cost change as a visitor adds and removes ingredients from their shopping list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the implications for developers?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the code layer of the API, let’s take the shopping list example a step further. Let&#8217;s say the blocks needed to build it have been created by three different developers. The Interactivity API has standardized the way that blocks load and communicate with each other. It creates a consistent, performant user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original proposal calls this composability and compatibility. It mentions a future state where interactive blocks can be combined and even nested in structures with defined behaviors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have a knack for making code do what they want. Not what it was intended for, ask any QA tester right after a launch. In the future, interactive blocks will work together. They won&#8217;t be limited by their original developer. Users will be able to create patterns and interactions that go beyond their original purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API and how it uses WordPress could be a pivotal moment in the Project&#8217;s history. It could create a new way of working with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the concept of single-page applications (SPAs). Today SPAs are often complex, expensive and inaccessible to most users. The Interactivity API, once more developed, could lead to a whole new kind of application category built with WordPress. How exciting would it be to unlock these types of patterns for everyday users?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the implications for WordPress businesses?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyday users will see the most impact from the Interactivity API. As blocks become more interoperable, the kinds of interactions that users can access will grow. Consequently, demand for more feature-rich or complex interactions may also grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactions API could unlock a whole new product category to monetize. It could lead to new partnerships as product businesses migrate their interactions to the block level. Think of the enterprise user who may be able to work with a suite of approved blocks. They could build performant, secure, and reliable applications in the stack and user interface they already know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely only scratching the surface of what could be possible. But it is clear that for WordPress to continue to outpace its rivals, innovations like the Interactivity API will need to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-5 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Author’s Note</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not a developer so while I’ve tried my best to capture and communicate the Interactivity API and its implications, I could be wrong. If that’s the case, let me know in the comments and I’ll make the corrections. Also worth a listen is the latest <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/02/episode-73-inside-the-interactivity-api/\"><strong>WordPress Briefing</strong> </a>where Josepha, Mario and Ryan discuss the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m curious about what you think. Am I totally off on this? Am I painting too ambitious a future state? Did I miss something glaringly obvious about the Interactivity API?</p>\n</div>\n",

      "slug": "look-whos-back-jquery-4-0-0-is-now-in-beta",
      "content": "\n<p>We weren’t here to report it in real-time, but on February 6, jQuery Core Team Lead Timmy Willison <a href=\"https://blog.jquery.com/2024/02/06/jquery-4-0-0-beta/\">announced</a> that jQuery 4.0.0 is now available in beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>jQuery 4.0.0 has been in the works for a long time, but it is now ready for a beta release! There’s a lot to cover, and the team is excited to see it released. We’ve got bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that were overly complicated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The post includes an overview of the changes, starting with the highlight: dropping support for IE10 and older. The team planned to part with IE11 after Microsoft ended support in 2022 but <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5077#issuecomment-1730205609\">eventually decided</a> to push this change to v5 to avoid any more blockers to the v4 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming release uses ES modules and switches from RequireJS to Rollup for packaging. It also removes 13 deprecated functions that “were either always meant to be internal or ones that now have native equivalents in all supported browsers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>78 Million Websites Use jQuery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adherence to modern browser behavior and specs is a common thread in the announcement post. Indeed, browsers have come a long way since January 2006, when jQuery was launched, Internet Explorer had a 90% market share, and front-end development was a constant struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=es6\">99.84% browser support</a> for ES6, a slew of well-supported <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API\">Web APIs</a>, and robust upgrades to CSS—when we can run a full-blown <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/\">WordPress instance in the browser</a> using WebAssembly—do we still need <a href=\"https://bundlephobia.com/package/jquery@3.7.0\">an 85.1 kB</a> DOM manipulation library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1al08pe/comment/kpi131o\">the words of an opinionated Redditor</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Look, jQuery was incredible and it changed JS in incredible ways. It made the JS developer experience incredible because it was so inventive. And the JS community and TC39 implemented so many things that jQ did incredible. It was one of the goals of jQ &#8211; set standards and improve the JS language. And it worked. And it&#8217;s no longer needed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by online statistics, the answer is an unequivocal “YES!”. jQuery might be the uncool kid in the front-end neighborhood, but its market share dwarfs the hipper frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on NPM, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery\">jQuery 3.7.1</a>, released in August 2023, boasts over 9 million weekly downloads and has more than 20k dependent packages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuiltWith <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/jQuery\">indicates</a> that over 78 million websites use jQuery, while W3Techs <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery\">reports</a> that “jQuery is used by 94.4% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 77.1% of all websites.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Legacy Dependency</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the chief reasons for jQuery’s relentless popularity is being instrumental to the ecosystem. Namely, it’s bundled in WordPress Core and is part of numerous themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress’ adoption of React-based Gutenberg has lowered its dependency on jQuery. During a Developer Hours session hosted a week after Willison’s announcement, titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/02/13/developer-hours-javascript-for-modern-wordpress-development/\">JavaScript for modern WordPress development</a>, Automattic’s developer advocates Ryan Welcher and Nick Diego spent more than an hour diving into JS tools and techniques to build blocks and editor extensions; they didn’t once mention jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/10/04/the-performance-impact-of-using-jquery-in-wordpress-themes/\">post published</a> in October 2021 on the Make Themes blog, core contributor Felix Arntz urged theme developers to move away from jQuery to improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60478\">TRAC ticket opened</a> on the day of Willison’s announcement reported the news and enquired, “Is this something that wp core will be looking to implement?”. Andrew Ozz, Lead Developer at Automattic, replied, “Of course :)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 43% share of the CMS market, WordPress could be the serum of jQuery’s longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large ticss-93c4e75b\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"122\" data-attachment-id=\"154072\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/jquery-logo\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jQuery-logo.png\" data-orig-size=\"523,128\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"jQuery logo\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Logo of the jQuery library.

It also has some glaring reviews about how helpful it is. Why would people building WordPress websites in 2024 need to use a plugin designed “as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.”?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Trailblazer that Moves the Web Forward</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer lies in an alarming comment found on W3Techs. A third of the websites that use jQuery run a version older than 3.x (3.0.0 was released in June 2016).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results correlate with <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/blog/jquery-idc-research\">a smaller-scoped study</a> conducted by the OpenJS Foundation and IDC in November 2023. Out of 509 survey respondents, 89% confirmed they use jQuery, with 56% deploying older versions, some no longer maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-source and standardization expert Tobie Langel, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/papers.html#jquery\">speaking at</a> the W3C’s Secure the Web Forward workshop, believes “jQuery’s massive reach and longevity” puts it in a unique position: if securing jQuery means securing the web, then “Once again&#8211;and against all odds&#8211;jQuery can be a trailblazer and help move the web forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s already an ongoing effort: <a href=\"https://openssf.org/blog/2022/10/24/openssf-project-alpha-omega-invests-in-the-openjs-foundation-and-jquery-to-help-secure-the-consumer-web/\">In October 2022</a>, the <a href=\"https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/\">Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Project Alpha-Omega</a> awarded jQuery a $350k grant to “reduce potential security incidents for jQuery by helping modernize its consumers and its code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by industry giants like the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, and part of the OpenJS Foundation supported by GoDaddy, IBM, Joyent, and the Sovereign Tech Fund, jQuery seems like it will get to live to see more than just another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How about you?

Identified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw, it poses a critical security risk, allowing attackers to potentially gain unauthorized control over websites running on an affected version of Bricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Bricks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bricksbuilder.io/\">Bricks</a> or Bricks Builder is a visual site builder that allows users to create web pages on WordPress without using code through their drag-and-drop interface. Unlike other similar products in the WordPress ecosystem which deliver functionality through plugins, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bricks-laying-down-a-foundation-in-the-wordpress-page-builder-market\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"114867\">Bricks Builder</a> uses the theme functionality as it’s way of delivering features to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding RCE Vulnerabilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RCE vulnerabilities are among the most critical types of security flaws. They allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a website from a remote location, allowing them to control the site, access confidential data, distribute malware, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timeline of the Patch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability disclosure timeline is commendable for its efficiency. The flaw was reported to Bricks by security research team snicco on February 10, 2024, marking the start of a swift and effective response. Bricks acknowledged the issue on the same day and, by February 13, had released the patch (1.9.6.1) following snicco&#8217;s recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update Highly Recommended</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-themes/bricks/bricks-196-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution#:~:text=The%20Bricks%20theme%20for%20WordPress,execute%20code%20on%20the%20server.\">Wordfence</a> has labelled the severity of this vulnerability a 9.8 out of 10 while <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/bricks/wordpress-bricks-theme-1-9-6-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability\">Patchstack</a> has labelled it a 10 out 10, marking it a critical update for website owners using Bricks. Users are urged to update their installations immediately to protect their sites from potential exploits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to learn more about how this security vulnerability was discovered, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_0ghjPXh5U\">Calvin Alkan will be joining Remkus de Vries</a> on his show for a discussion on this and other related security topics.</p>\n",

While both have created news in technology circles it is the CRA that has been <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/concerns-over-the-european-unions-cyber-resilience-act-cra/\">of particular concern to the WordPress community</a> and other open-source projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/Open_Letter_on_the_Significance_of_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_in_the_EU_s_Proposed_Cyber_Resilience_Act.pdf\">open letter to EU legislators in July 2023</a>, the leaders of WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and TYPO3 highlighted the risks to open-source and began a collaborative effort called the Inter-CMS Working Group to bring about significant change to the wording proposed in the CRA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Impact of Collaborative Advocacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In early December, after several months of dialogue, investigation and negotiation, the EU parliament <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-17000-2023-INIT/EN/pdf\">released an updated draft of the legislation</a> that looks to have resolved many of the primary concerns raised by open-source communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revised Act makes a concerted effort to ensure that the regulations are practical and do not hinder the collaborative spirit or the ways of working that open-source projects like WordPress rely on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the success of amending the CRA as a foundation to build on, the four open-source communities represented in the Inter-CMS Working Group recently <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-co-founds-the-open-website-alliance\">established the Open Web Alliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Alliance, <a href=\"https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/documents/press_releases/2024-02_Open_Website_Alliance/Open_Website_Alliance_Charter.pdf\">now formalized with a charter</a>, represents a collective commitment to furthering the education about and advocacy of open-source benefits and principles. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-7 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1880\" height=\"1253\" data-attachment-id=\"153916\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/eu-regulatory-success-prompts-open-source-cms-leaders-to-form-alliance/pexels-photo-2871654\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Photo by Federico Orlandi on &lt;a href=\\&quot;https:\\/\\/www.pexels.com\\/photo\\/white-and-brown-concrete-building-2871654\\/\\&quot; rel=\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Pexels.com&lt;\\/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;white and brown concrete building&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pexels-photo-2871654\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Photo by Federico Orlandi on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-and-brown-concrete-building-2871654/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654-300x200.jpeg\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654-500x333.jpeg\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654.jpeg\" alt=\"Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany.\" class=\"wp-image-153916\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654.jpeg 1880w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1880px) 100vw, 1880px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by Federico Orlandi on <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-and-brown-concrete-building-2871654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pexels.com</a></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Future of the Open Web Alliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance aims to promote and defend the rights of open-source projects, aspiring to create a better web. It emphasizes encouraging the use of open-source software, sharing best practices, and supporting third-party open-source projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This collaborative body, while not a legal entity, signifies a structured approach to ensuring open-source software remains a vibrant and integral part of the digital landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, the presence of the Open Web Alliance could be a game-changer in how open-source communities navigate regulatory challenges and advocate for policies that recognize and support the unique nature of open-source development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its charter underscores a commitment to openness, trust, and quality, offering a platform for open-source CMS projects to collaborate more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition toward a more formalized alliance underscores the WordPress community’s role not just in advocacy, but in shaping a future where open-source principles are acknowledged and protected in the global digital policy arena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s foundation and its charter reflect a mature, strategic approach to ensuring that the ethos of open-source software continues to thrive amidst an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating A Regulatory Future: Implications for WordPress Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent developments around the CRA and the active role of the (now) Open Web Alliance highlight a broader trend: the regulatory landscape impacting open-source software is evolving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WordPress businesses, the amendments to the CRA represent a momentary sigh of relief, but the horizon suggests that regulatory challenges will persist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a business perspective, the future willingness of enterprises and government entities to adopt open-source software may hinge on how effectively the community can navigate these regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s efforts to advocate for open-source principles–emphasizing security, reliability, and openness–become crucial in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth considering that the relationship dynamics between government entities, enterprises, and open-source vendors are likely to evolve. A failure to leverage open-source software due to regulatory or compliance concerns could limit innovation and flexibility for governments and businesses alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the WordPress ecosystem, this underscores the importance of supporting initiatives like the Open Web Alliance, ensuring that open-source software remains a viable, attractive option for all users, regardless of the regulatory climate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on education, advocacy, and the development of compliance tools, the WordPress community can help mitigate potential reservations from enterprise and government sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proactive stance not only defends the community’s interests but also promotes the fundamental advantages of open-source software in fostering innovation, security, and a more inclusive digital future.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>What do you think?

He encouraged community members to commit to using AI to expand their knowledge:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8230;<strong><em> our growth and development will only be limited by our curiosity. </em></strong></p>\n<cite>Matt</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: practicing what he preaches, Matt shared that in order to enhance accessibility, the State of the Word recordings will soon be available in five languages, thanks to AI tools lipsync-ing addresses in Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, and Japanese. Available over the coming few days!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charting the Course for 2024: Data Liberation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt emphasized a new focus for 2024:  unlocking the web&#8217;s full potential, by focusing on 1-click data migration &#8211; from other platforms to WordPress and among WordPress sites. He invited community members to join the initiative, and shared that the teams will have all necessary tools at their disposal to deliver on this priority. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SOTW Reveal: WordCamp US Heading to&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an exciting revelation, WordCamp US is set to unfold its magic in Portland, Oregon, for the next two years.

Ten years… wow!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t had the time to find a new writer for the Tavern in the time between when Sarah gave her notice a few weeks ago and now. There&#8217;s never a dull moment in tech and my priorities with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress core</a> and <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> ended up taking more time than I expected. Funding and supporting the Tavern to do independent WordPress journalism is an important part of the WP ecosystem—we need a site that covers our space without care for affiliate links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Impeccable integrity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Relentless curiosity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A blogger&#8217;s hustle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Passion for news and technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technical ability to tinker with WordPress, plugins, and themes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Please send an email to matt at my last name dot com, with [wptavern] at the beginning of the subject, and the following things in the email:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why you think you&#8217;d be best in the world for this job.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Links to three things you&#8217;ve written that you feel represent your style well.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A link to your homepage and any social media you keep up with.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Link or attach a resume, but don&#8217;t worry too much about this, the first two are more important.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your <a href=\"https://w.org/\">W.org</a> username, and sign up for the Slack there so I can ping you.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And please send in the application by November 24th! We&#8217;ll take this week off but hopefully come back blazing after Thanksgiving. I&#8217;ll review everything over the weekend when I have some time off planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll try out a number of folks on an hourly contract ($25/hr, same as Automattic) as a trial, and if that goes well we&#8217;ll aim to hire two full-time writers by the end of the year. A full-time offer also includes generous benefits including full coverage on health care and 6% 401k matching. You&#8217;ll be an employee of <a href=\"https://audrey.co/\">Audrey</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The job is to write frequently about the goings-on in the WordPress world and foster a healthy discussion and community here on the site. If you&#8217;re doing your job well, it should be reflected in traffic and comments on the site.  You will set the tone and discussion in the WordPress community, and drive the narrative. Every post will be syndicated to every wp-admin in the world. You don&#8217;t have to start out a WordPress expert, but you&#8217;ll become one. You&#8217;ll have a ton of autonomy, so need to be self-driven and able to manage yourself. (You can ask previous writers how much I was in their hair. 😀)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Midjourney prompt: a stunning landscape scene with a tranquil atmosphere.

      "content": "\n<p>This has been an emotional, bittersweet morning for me, reading through old posts, as I close the book on my time at this beloved publication. Today is my last day before moving on to embrace a new challenge in the world of tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, the year I started writing at the Tavern, just <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y\">17.4% of the web</a> was running on WordPress, but the momentum I felt at that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-state-of-the-word-highlights-internationalization-mobile-and-new-tools-for-wordpress-contributors\">last WordCamp San Francisco</a> was intoxicating and undeniable. It marked the ascendency of the global WordPress community and the move to embrace new tools like Slack and GitHub for contributing to core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, one frustrating thing I frequently heard was &#8220;It&#8217;s just WordPress, don&#8217;t take it so seriously.&#8221; Yet there we were, standing on the edge of an amazing acceleration of WordPress&#8217; adoption and expansion of the ecosystem that brought meaningful work to millions and gave people a voice on the web. It was never &#8220;just WordPress&#8221; to me. As the software enters its third decade, powering 43% of the world&#8217;s websites, WordPress continues to be an irrepressible force of good on the web. I&#8217;d like to think the Tavern had a small part in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to thank past colleagues Jeff Chandler, Justin Tadlock, and Nathan Wrigley, as well as Matt Mullenweg for supporting the publication for so many years. We have done a lot of daily reporting but the Tavern keeper is a watchdog at heart. Our commitment to serving the public interest was instrumental in holding companies, authorities, and the open source project accountable, and I am proud of the work we did together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started, I had no idea how I would fully embrace the challenge of writing, editing, and publishing&nbsp;WordPress news every day. It changed me. Writing news is an intensely public job that comes with a nearly constant onslaught of criticism. I found that showing up even on my worst days forged a level of discipline that was previously inaccessible to me. Today, 3,021 articles later, publishing is in my blood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To our wonderful community of readers: Thank you for trusting us to tell your stories. Thank you to every one of you who chose to speak to the press &#8211; both on the record and anonymously when something needed to come to light. You made it possible for the Tavern to become the most authoritative and reliable source of WordPress news on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We navigated many challenging times together and celebrated previously unbelievable milestones. I&#8217;ve been privileged to have a front row seat to your innovation and determination, and I&#8217;ll continue cheering for your success. Thank you, beautiful WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In honor of 10 years at the Tavern, I&#8217;ll leave you with 10 of my favorite articles for a short trip down memory lane. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-freedom-and-opportunity-with-wordpress-how-wolf-bishop-overcame-prison-and-addiction-to-launch-a-career\">Finding Freedom and Opportunity With WordPress: How Wolf Bishop Overcame Prison and Addiction to Launch a Career</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-welch-news-uses-wordpress-to-keep-local-news-alive-in-west-virginia\">How The Welch News Uses WordPress To Keep Local News Alive in West Virginia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives\">AMP Has Irreparably Damaged Publishers’ Trust in Google-led Initiatives</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-turns-20\">WordPress Turns 20</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tectonic-shifts-in-retail-industry-are-creating-unprecedented-opportunities-for-independent-stores\">Tectonic Shifts in Retail Industry are Creating Unprecedented Opportunities for Independent Stores</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-wordpress-in-the-post-print-news-era\">Finding WordPress in the Post-Print News Era</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-rc-expected-on-u-s-thanksgiving-holiday-despite-last-minute-pushback-from-contributors\">WordPress 5.0 RC Expected on U.S. Thanksgiving Holiday, Despite Last-Minute Pushback from Contributors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-smiley-wars-will-core-adopt-new-emoticons\">WordPress Smiley Wars: Will Core Adopt New Emoticons?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/rip-buddypress-default-theme-finally-laid-to-rest-in-1-9\">RIP BuddyPress Default Theme: Finally Laid to Rest in 1.9</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014\">WordPress Beyond Boundaries: A Recap of WordCamp Europe 2014</a></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2023/11/16/woocommerce-8-3-0-released/\">WooCommerce 8.3</a> was released today, featuring Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation blocks as the default checkout flow for new installations. This is a major milestone in moving WooCommerce towards a block-first checkout experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 8.3 was slightly <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2023/11/14/woocommerce-8-3-delayed/\">delayed</a>, as core developers worked to ensure it would be compatible with the latest changes in WordPress 6.4 as well as the upcoming PHP 8.3 release scheduled for November 23, 2023. They also wanted to give time for plugin developers to prepare for the new reality of cart and checkout blocks as the default. An <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2023/11/06/faq-extending-cart-and-checkout-blocks/\">FAQ document</a> outlines the steps for developers who still need to make their extensions compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers with extensions that don&#8217;t work with the new default blockified checkout are encouraged to <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2023/11/06/faq-extending-cart-and-checkout-blocks/\">declare their plugins incompatible</a>, so WooCommerce can display a message to users in the settings sidebar. (No action is required for plugins that do not extend the cart and checkout flow).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2023/11/06/faq-extending-cart-and-checkout-blocks/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"924\" data-attachment-id=\"151398\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-8-3-makes-cart-checkout-and-order-confirmation-blocks-default-on-new-installations/image-13-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.png\" data-orig-size=\"1600,924\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-13\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-300x173.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-500x289.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151398\" style=\"width:620px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.png 1600w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-300x173.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-500x289.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-768x444.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-1536x887.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">image source: <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2023/11/06/faq-extending-cart-and-checkout-blocks/\">FAQ: Cart and Checkout Blocks by Default</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although existing stores are not impacted by cart and checkout blocks becoming the default, merchants can easily opt into the experience using WooCommerce&#8217;s migration tool located at WooCommerce > Status > Tools > Create Pages. This tool will automatically generate the new pages with a block-based checkout flow. The blockified Order Confirmation template is currently only available to stores that are using block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable changes in WooCommerce 8.3 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Themes added to the revamped WooCommerce > Extensions marketplace</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketplace search improved</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mobile app onboarding improved, no longer requiring Jetpack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Images optimized to reduce the WooCommerce package size</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce 8.3 includes 682 commits to the core plugin, along with 231 commits rolled in from WooCommerce blocks, thanks to the efforts of 96 contributors. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/release/8.3/plugins/woocommerce/readme.txt\">changelog</a> for a more detailed look at the many fixes, tweaks, and enhancements included in the release.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Elementor, the most popular website builder plugin for WordPress with more than 5 million active installations, has <a href=\"https://elementor.com/blog/updates-to-the-elementor-pro-essential-plan/\">announced</a> major changes coming to the features included in its <a href=\"https://elementor.com/pricing-plugin/\">Elementor Pro Essential</a> subscription plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan will still include the Theme Builder along with access to 50+ Pro widgets, basic marketing tools, and the Form widget, but it will shift other more advanced features to the more expensive pricing tiers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Going forward, when you purchase the new Elementor Pro Essential, you will have all the features you need to create a complete basic website, and also gain access to new features that will be part of the Essential plan,&#8221; Elementor Senior Product Marketing Manager Gabriella Laster said. &#8220;For more professional capabilities like the Popup Builder, e-commerce features including PayPal button, Stripe button, and the full WooCommerce Builder or collaboration tools like Notes or the Role Manager, you will need to upgrade to the Advanced plan or higher.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes, which are detailed in a comparison chart in the announcement, will be rolled out on December 4, 2023. It will not affect existing subscribers or other subscription plans:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Existing Essential subscribers get to keep all current features.<br>If you have a valid Elementor Pro Essential subscription, you can keep your subscription with all the features currently available to you, at no additional cost. You’ll also be able to renew your subscription upon expiration, while keeping all the features currently available in your plan. Some new features, released to the higher plans, will not be available as part of your current Pro subscription.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods Framework, commented on the news in Post Status&#8217; Slack in regards to how Pods will support Elementor users in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Elementor Pro is removing things like ACF/Pods integration from their lowest tier &#8216;Essential&#8217; plan in December,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;Existing subscribers keep the functionality but anyone getting new licenses after Dec 4th won’t have those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s not super clear since I don’t use the other features whether they’ve removed many other things or if some of those things are actually new features shipping in December to just the other plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The impact of this is that I’ve chosen to replace the Elementor Pro integration for Pods that they provide — with a more complete alternative solution within the <a href=\"https://pods-pro.skc.dev/downloads/page-builder-toolkit/\">Page Builder Toolkit add-on</a>. Previously, only new Pods-centric widgets were added. Soon I’ll add dynamic content support for Pods that will be available as a better alternative to what is in Elementor Pro currently.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerned Elementor customers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elemntor/status/1724510399268024325\">reacted to the news on X/Twitter</a> as well as in the comments of the announcement, many looking for reassurance that the features they paid for will still be accessible to them after the change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anti-Elementor crowd responded to their concerns in a critical and dismissive way, using the news of the modified plans as an opportunity to express and reinforce their disapproval of the page builder. This prompted those who are reluctantly using the tool to ask for viable alternatives in the comments of the tweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Don&#39;t blame Elementor because its license plans were changed.<br><br>Just blame yourself because you are using it.</p>&mdash; Mauro Bono (@UpTheIrons1978) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UpTheIrons1978/status/1724807452443734302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor has had a somewhat contentious relationship with the open source project, as it has historically <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/elementor-raises-eyebrows-with-google-ads-targeting-full-site-editing\">marketed itself against WordPress core</a>. The plugin&#8217;s reputation has been saddled with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenbergs-faster-performance-is-eroding-page-builders-dominance\">bloat and performance concerns</a> for years, calling its long-term future into question. The writing was on the wall for most page builders when WordPress decided to land full-site editing capabilities in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor has made a pattern of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/elementor-to-roll-out-significant-pricing-hike-for-new-customers\">making major changes to pricing and plans</a> while also guaranteeing legacy pricing for current customers. It&#8217;s one strategy for getting customers to lock in their auto-renewals to ensure a more predictable financial future for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months ago, Human Made engineer Fränk Klein sparked a conversation on X/Twitter contending that &#8220;Elementor will disappear as a standalone plugin, along with all other non-block page builders,&#8221; as the WordPress ecosystem moves to become block-first by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since 2022, all default themes are block themes,&#8221; Klein said. &#8220;WordPress.com is all in on blocks. WooCommerce is modernizing with blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For plugin authors the biggest return on investment is to use blocks. So it falls to the page builder developer to ensure that plugins integrate well. And that&#8217;s a difficult, tedious, and costly undertaking.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Elementor is without a doubt the most popular page builder.<br><br>But even with its huge marketshare, I would never use it. No matter how good it is.<br><br>Because sooner or later, Elementor will disappear as a standalone plugin. Along with all other non-block page builders.<br><br>There are…</p>&mdash; Fränk Klein (@fklux) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fklux/status/1706291126951428215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg also weighed in on the news, indirectly referencing Elementor&#8217;s latest move to slash features in its Essential tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As Gutenberg gets more capable, non-Gutenberg site builders will likely need to continue raising their prices, as one is in the news for today, to maintain revenue churn in the face of higher churn and fewer new users,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1724843773224530312\">said</a>. &#8220;I don&#8217;t [think] this trend will happen for the Gutenberg-based ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll also need to spend more to keep up, as they have to duplicate all the engineering that&#8217;s going into core. This is why we asked them all to plan on Gutenberg since we started development in 2017. Phases 1 and 2 also could have gone a lot faster with their help. The pace of iteration is pretty <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases\">relentless</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor&#8217;s decision to reallocate features across pricing tiers is a response to the shifting dynamics within the page builder landscape and the increasing cost of supporting so many third-party integrations in the entry level plan. WordPress users and developers are slowly reevaluating their relationship with page builders, as every core release puts a greater emphasis on block-based editing for both content and design. This is a fundamental shift in how WordPress websites are built and page builders will continue to be challenged in striking a balance between innovation, user expectations, and business sustainability.</p>\n",

LatePoint is used on 21,000 websites to enable bookings for small businesses, such as salons, therapists, doctors, spas, and fitness studios. It also supports a growing <a href=\"https://latepoint.com/addons\">library of add-ons</a> for further customizing the booking experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a strategic investment, primarily made to begin integrating LatePoint into our products and offer it to our customers,&#8221; Brainstorm Force CEO Sujay Pawar said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thousands of businesses build their websites with our Astra theme and Starter Templates every day. Many of these businesses could benefit if they were able to get bookings for their services from the websites they built. So, this investment allows us to offer a deeply integrated booking and appointment solution to these customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zipwp.com/\">ZipWP</a>, the AI WordPress website builder product the company recently launched, will be utilizing LatePoint in the websites that are generated with appointment booking and scheduling features. Brainstorm Force also plans to integrate LatePoint features into its <a href=\"https://wpspectra.com/\">Spectra</a> page builder, which is based on Gutenberg and has more than 600,000 active installs. Spectra will be updated to include blocks for bookings and appointment scheduling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is integrating LatePoint across its entire product suite, including adding it to <a href=\"https://surecart.com/\">SureCart</a>, their e-commerce plugin, to enable small businesses to accept subscription payments. Brainstorm Force will be including it with its <a href=\"https://suretriggers.com/\">SureTriggers</a> automation platform to connect LatePoint to other WordPress apps, plugins, and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We realized that the service commerce space within WordPress was somewhat underserved,&#8221; Pawar said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Platforms like Squarespace offer Acuity Scheduling and Wix provides Wix Bookings. SaaS solutions like Calendly often come with very limited features and substantially high monthly recurring costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Within the WordPress ecosystem, there are a few options, such as WooCommerce Bookings, Amelia, Bookly, etc. We meticulously evaluated all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What impressed us most about LatePoint was its exceptional code quality, modern design flexibility, and robustness.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pawar said the investment is in the six-figures but the exact amount will not be disclosed due to a confidentiality clause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea behind the investment is to initiate this partnership and possibly acquire LatePoint in the future,&#8221; Pawar said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brainstorm Force currently offers more than 70 products that power 7+ million websites. This new investment is aimed at capturing small business customers with a payment and booking solutions fully integrated with the company&#8217;s starter templates and other products.</p>\n",

ElmaStudio released its first block theme, Aino, in 2021 and four commercial block themes during 2022, including one WooCommerce theme. The company has been creating WordPress themes since 2011 and brings a wealth of experience along with meticulous, thoughtful design decisions to the new world of block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-founder Ellen Bauer created a video with a quick overview of the new Moog theme. She demonstrates how to customize page templates and shows how to add an SVG logo that will automatically adjust with the style variations. The company is not just creating block themes but is also educating users on how to take advantage of all the customization options, as template editing is a capability that was previously out of reach for most users in the classic themes era.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSE28aUkjgU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://themes.elmastudio.de/moog/\">live demo</a> on the ElmaStudio website to see the theme in action, or take it for a <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=moog\">test drive using WordPress Playground</a>.

      "content": "\n<p>WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy has published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/06/proposal-2024-major-release-timing/\">proposed schedule</a> for 2024 that includes three major core releases. The dates have not yet been set in stone but have been planned to avoid major holidays and WordPress events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first release of the year, WordPress 6.5, is scheduled for March 26, followed by 6.6 in July and 6.7 in early November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WordPress had officially concluded Phase 2 of the Gutenberg project (focused on Site Customiziation), 6.4 was focused primarily on extending existing features in the block and site editors alongside initial explorations of Phase 3 (Collaboration). Releases in 2024 will go full force into collaboration features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given that 2024 will hold a bulk of the work for Phase 3, I expect that 6.5 and 6.7 will be focused on those Collaborative features,&#8221; Chomphosy said. &#8220;I would like to propose that 6.6 be held specifically for maintenance and general polish of the software (as was wished for earlier this year).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy asked for feedback on the timing and focus of the planned releases. WordPress core committer Pascal Birchler suggested swapping the focuses for 6.5 and 6.6, as it&#8217;s not clear how much of of Phase 3 work will be ready in time for 6.5. The suggestion also makes sense in light of the features that didn&#8217;t make the cut for the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4&#8217;s release squad had to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-font-library-feature-punted-to-6-5-release\">punt the planned typography management flagship features</a> and these are anticipated to land in 6.5. This includes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/52698\">Font Library</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41479\">server-side @font-face CSS generation and printing</a>, which will allow users to browse a library of fonts in the admin, similar to managing media. It will not be dependent on the theme that is activated but will be a library that is extensible for plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion regarding 2024 releases is still ongoing in the comments of the post. WordPress users may also hear more about what&#8217;s coming in the next year during <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2023-will-broadcast-live-from-madrid-on-december-11\">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word address</a>, which will be delivered live from Madrid on December 11, 2023.</p>\n",

      "slug": "wordfence-launches-bug-bounty-program",
      "content": "\n<p>Wordfence <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/11/wordfence-launches-bug-bounty-program-to-fund-wordpress-security-research-and-showcase-researchers/\">launched a bug bounty program</a> today to provide financial incentive for security researchers reporting high risk vulnerabilities to the company&#8217;s program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researchers disclose vulnerabilities to Wordfence, the company triages them and confidentially discloses them to the vendors to fix. When the fix is released, the vulnerability will be included in Wordfence&#8217;s public database, which is free to access, following a responsible disclosure policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is no cap on the rewards an individual researcher can earn, and every single in-scope vulnerability received via our submissions process earns a reward bounty,&#8221; Wordfence security analyst Chloe Chamberland said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence will reward researchers who discover vulnerabilities in plugins and themes with 50,000+ active installations. A few examples of the payouts include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1,600 for an Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload, a Remote Code Execution, a Privilege Escalation to Admin, or an Arbitrary Options Update in a plugin or theme with over one million active installations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,060 for an Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion in a plugin or theme with over one million active installations, assuming wp-config.php can easily be deleted.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$800 for an Unauthenticated SQL Injection in a plugin or theme with over one million active installations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$320 for an Unauthenticated Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in a plugin or theme with over one million active installations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$80 for a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in a plugin or theme with over one million active installations, and a significant impact.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our Bug Bounty Program has been designed to have the greatest positive impact on the security of the WordPress ecosystem,&#8221; Chamberland said. &#8220;Rewards are not earned by bulk hunting for vulnerabilities with minimal impact and earning a place on a leaderboard, but rather, they are based on active install counts, the criticality of the vulnerability, the ease of exploitation, and the prevalence of the vulnerability type.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence&#8217;s bug bounty program launch was clearly vying for competitive positioning by indirectly calling out Patchstack, which <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/alliance/\">operates its program on a leaderboard system</a> where only the top researchers get paid. There are a few notable differences, where some bounties are awarded by discretion but most individual bounties are for the highest score in various categories:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Patchstack guarantees a monthly prize pool of at least $2425 (the lowest possible prize pool). Patchstack Alliance member who will collect the most points for a particular month from their submitted reports will get the $650 bounty, the second place will get $350 and the third will get $250.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have extra bounties (single bounties) for reporting the vulnerability with the highest CVSS ver. 3.1 base score; the highest active install count; and for reporting a group of components affected by the same vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack can reward individual Patchstack Alliance members at their discretion based on the overall impact of the vulnerabilities they discover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence is taking a different approach in paying for every vulnerability reported within the scope identified by the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers in the WordPress ecosystem should familiarize themselves with the various bug bounty programs and determine the best avenue for their disclosures. Some plugins and companies, such as <a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/elementor/\">Elementor</a>, <a href=\"https://brainstormforce.com/bug-bounty-program/\">Brainstorm Force</a>, <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/automattic?type=team\">Automattic</a>, <a href=\"https://castos.com/security/\">Castos</a>, and <a href=\"https://app.intigriti.com/programs/wpengine/wpengine/detail\">WP Engine</a>, have their own bug bounty programs, with a range of different payouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We pay more per vulnerability and we pay for every valid vulnerability submitted,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder said. &#8220;We feel this is the only fair way to do it because gamification of a vulnerability program is like having employees who all work, but only those at the top of the leaderboard get paid. If you submit a valid vulnerability, you should get paid for your work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maunder contends that the wrong incentives are driving down the quality of the research submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are an extremely high number of low risk and low quality vulnerabilities being submitted to databases like Patchstack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Vulnerabilities that involve a Cross-Site Request Forgery are an example of this. The incentives we are seeing out there encourage researchers to generate a a high volume of low risk vulnerabilities to get rewarded. These high numbers are then used to market security products.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maunder said Wordfence has structured its program around shifting the incentives to reward research into high risk vulnerabilities, instead of ramping up the marketing metrics for a particular vulnerability database. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A high volume of low risk vulnerabilities in any particular database harms the industry because it creates work for other organizations who have to integrate this data, but for the most part it is useless noise that we are forced to sift through, rather than representing any real-world risk to the user community,&#8221; Maunder said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack CEO Oliver Sild responded to these claims with data he says demonstrates that Wordfence is also responsible for producing a high volume of low risk vulnerability CVE&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordFence as a CNA actually produces lower risk vulnerability CVE’s in average compared to all 3 CNA’s in the WordPress space,&#8221; Sild said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CVE’s with CVSS equal or higher than 5 (2023)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Patchstack: 91.39%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WPscan: 77.89%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordFence: 72.52%</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CVE’s with CVSS equal or higher than 7 (2023)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Patchstack: 49.76%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordFence: 34.53%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WPscan: 20.92%</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CVE’s with CVSS equal or higher than 8 (2023)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Patchstack: 30.02%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordFence: 24.90%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WPscan: 12.05%</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CVE’s with CVSS equal or higher than 9 (2023)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordFence: 9.37%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WPscan: 4.60%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patchstack: 2.42%</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordFence does indeed on average assign highest % of CVSS 9+ CVE’s (though, they are also the smallest CNA of all three), but the high CVSS alone doesn’t determine wether the vulnerability will become exploited and the reality is that vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in the WordPress ecosystem often have lower CVSS scores,&#8221; Sild said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Also, keep in mind that we at Patchstack have almost 2x higher volume of new vulnerability reports coming in (more than WPscan and WordFence combined), so obviously this also lowers the average for us on the edge scores.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the newcomer to the group of WordPress companies offering bug bounties, Wordfence is entering the market with the intention of attracting more reports through additional bonuses (10% for the first 6 months) and a bonus structure that rewards chaining multiple vulnerabilities together, thorough documentation, and other extra efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every author of a popular plugin or theme can afford to offer their own bug bounty program, and this is where security companies are stepping in to fill in the gaps. More competition across companies for high quality research can only be good for WordPress users, as it provides more incentive for securing the ecosystem and will potentially attract more skilled researchers. The bug bounty programs will likely evolve over time as companies refine them to provide the best value for original research.</p>\n",

      "slug": "wordpress-6-4-1-fixes-a-critical-curl-requests-bug",
      "content": "\n<p>WordPress contributors have worked quickly over the past 24 hours to prepare a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/11/wordpress-6-4-1-maintenance-release/\">6.4.1 maintenance release</a> after <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59842\">a critical bug</a> emerged from a change in the Requests library, causing problems with updates on servers running older versions of cURL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting companies began reporting widespread impact of the bug. Tom Sommer, from one of Denmark&#8217;s largest hosting companies, filed a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Requests/issues/838\">issue</a> outlining how the cURL timeouts were affecting sites:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Requests/pull/657\">#657</a>&nbsp;breaks downloads towards&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.wordpress.org/\">https://api.wordpress.org/</a>&nbsp;and many other sites when using Curl 7.29.0 (and perhaps other versions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>Error: RuntimeException: Failed to get url 'https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/?locale=en_US': cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 10000 milliseconds with 807 out of -1 bytes received.</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>It also causes issues with the REST API in Site Health with the error:&nbsp;<code>REST API response: (http_request_failed) cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 10005 milliseconds with XXX out of XXX bytes received”</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>It also prevents WordPress plugin and core updates, basically anything that relies on the internal Curl handler in WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue became a top priority as it wasn&#8217;t clear how it would be possible for users to receive an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even if you fix this now <strong>the issue prevents any future auto-upgrade to a 6.4.1</strong>, since it breaks Curl requests, so the only way for people to update would be manually,&#8221; Sommer said. &#8220;The longer you wait, the bigger the problem will become.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nexcess reported tens of thousands of sites being affected by the bug. The issue was beyond what most users would be able to manually patch on their own, relegating hosts to figure out how to update their customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All my websites locked after updating to WordPress 6.4,&#8221;  Javier Martín González reported. &#8220;The ones without updates are working normally.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bug was also reported to be causing <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/issues/2751\">causing potential Stripe API, WP-Admin, and performance issues</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquid Web/Nexcess product manager Tiffany Bridge <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C3D6T7F8Q/p1699463613987679\">summarized</a> how this problem emerged:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It looks like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Someone <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54588\">reported a bug</a> having to do with an interaction between his Intrusion Protection System and WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They then <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Requests/pull/657\">submitted their own patch</a> to WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The project lead for that area asked the submitter to write tests, which he did not do</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then they merged the PR anyway, despite the lack of tests</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meanwhile hosts are all going to have to revert that change ourselves on our own fleets so that our customers can still have little things like core and plugin updates if we are running an affected cURL version. (7.29 confirmed, there may be others)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core contributors will have to get to the bottom of how this bug was allowed through, via a postmortem or other discussion to prevent this from happening on such a large scale in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4.1 <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57086\">updates the Requests library</a> from version <code>2.0.8</code> to <code>2.0.9</code>. as a hotfix release to mitigate the issue. It reverts the problematic change. Version 6.4.1 also includes <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=closed&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;status=reviewing&amp;id=!59852&amp;milestone=6.4.1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;order=priority\">fixes for three other separate issues</a>.

      "content": "\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Performance team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">proposing</a> merging Performant Translations into core in time for the upcoming WordPress 6.5 release. After an in-depth performance analysis earlier this year revealed that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-analysis-finds-translations-may-significantly-slow-down-sites\">translations can significantly impact server response times</a>, the team discussed various solutions and landed on one that requires no configuration from users. More than 2,000 WordPress sites have tested it through the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a> feature plugin, after it was released in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance Team contributor Pascal Birchler, who penned the proposal to merge the plugin into core, explained how it speeds up sites using translations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Performant Translations is powered by a new, lightweight i18n library that is faster at loading binary MO files and uses less memory. It even supports loading multiple locales at the same time, which makes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/user-admin-languages-and-locale-switching-in-4-7/\">locale switching</a> faster. In addition to that, it supports translations contained in PHP files, avoiding a binary file format and leveraging OPCache if available. If an MO translation file has a corresponding PHP file, the latter will be loaded instead, making things even faster and use even less memory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Birchler also published some compelling benchmarks demonstrating the plugin&#8217;s ability to reduce memory usage and decrease load time:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:17px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>Locale</th><th>Scenario</th><th>Memory Usage</th><th>Load Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>en_US</td><td>Default</td><td>15 MB</td><td>159 ms</td></tr><tr><td>de_DE</td><td>Default</td><td>29 MB</td><td>217 ms</td></tr><tr><td>de_DE</td><td>Performant Translations</td><td>17 MB</td><td>166 ms</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">source: proposal for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">Merging Performant Translations into Core</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance team has opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59656\">ticket</a> for merging the plugin into WordPress 6.5. Core committer Felix Arntz marked it as a high priority for the next release &#8220;due to the significant estimated impact this will have for localized sites&#8217; performance.&#8221; The improvements stand to have a positive impact on the majority of WordPress sites (more than 50%) that are using translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 is expected in late March 2024. Getting merged this early in the release cycle would give Performant Translations the time it needs to be more widely tested and ready to go.  Users who don&#8217;t want to wait until next year to get these reported performance improvements can install the plugin in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Performant Translations plugin will continue to be maintained even after a core merge to build on top of the core solution with a distinct additional feature,&#8221; Birchler said. &#8220;As is already the case today, the plugin will automatically convert any MO files to PHP files if a PHP file does not currently exist. This is useful for sites where translations are not coming from translate.wordpress.org or only exist locally on that server.&#8221;</p>\n",

It&#8217;s a simple, yet elegant &#8220;expand on click&#8221; feature that allows visitors to expand images to be full-screen without leaving the page. The lightbox can be enabled on a per-image basis or site-wide under Styles » Blocks » Images.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1009\" height=\"561\" data-attachment-id=\"151084\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-introduces-twenty-twenty-four-theme-adds-lightbox-block-hooks-and-improvements-across-design-tools/image-9-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png\" data-orig-size=\"1009,561\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-300x167.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-500x278.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151084\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png 1009w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-300x167.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-500x278.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9-768x427.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Redesigned Command Palette</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The Command Palette has gotten a design refresh in 6.4 in order to accommodate a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/12/core-editor-improvement-commanding-the-command-palette/\">growing catalog of commands</a> available to help users perform tasks more efficiently.

WordPress 6.4 adds media previews for the Gallery and Image blocks in the List View. It also allows users to assign custom names for Group blocks, which are visible in the List View so they can be easily organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" data-attachment-id=\"151095\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-introduces-twenty-twenty-four-theme-adds-lightbox-block-hooks-and-improvements-across-design-tools/image-11-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11.png\" data-orig-size=\"1024,666\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-300x195.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-500x325.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151095\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11.png 1024w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-300x195.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-500x325.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-768x500.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">image credit: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/11/shirley/\">WordPress 6.4 release post</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Block Hooks</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-6-introduces-block-hooks-improvements-to-toolbars-on-nested-blocks\">Block Hooks</a> are a new developer feature, originally introduced in Gutenberg 16.4 for auto-inserting blocks. Developers can specify a location where a block will be inserted, such as before or after a template. Users can then reposition the blocks after insertion using the editor tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Twenty Twenty-Four</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4 ships with a brand new default theme, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-unveils-design-for-upcoming-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>. It was designed to be a multi-purpose theme, suitable for building a wide range of websites, including blogs, businesses, and portfolios.

Jetpack Creator is aimed at users who want to monetize their content and subscribers. It supports e-books, courses, paid newsletters, advertising, paywalled access, and other content monetization options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market size of the creator economy is growing and established social networking apps are updating their offerings to better serve creators who are marketing themselves independently. According to <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/the-creator-economy-could-approach-half-a-trillion-dollars-by-2027.html\">Goldman Sachs Research</a>, the creator economy could approach half-a-trillion dollars by 2027:  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>As the ecosystem grows, the total addressable market of the creator economy could roughly double in size over the next five years to $480 billion by 2027 from $250 billion today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs Research expects the 50 million global creators to grow at a 10-20% compound annual growth rate during the next five years.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Creator bundles monetization features aimed at this market. It enables access to 40+ blocks that allow creators to paywall content, add subscriber forms, accept donations, start a newsletter, and receive payment via Stripe or PayPal. Jetpack Creator also extends existing products, like adding the ability to import unlimited subscribers. The free Newsletter product caps subscriber imports at 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"869\" height=\"670\" data-attachment-id=\"151042\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-12-8-launches-jetpack-creator-for-monetizing-content-and-subscribers/image-2-5\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2.png\" data-orig-size=\"869,670\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-300x231.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-500x386.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151042\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2.png 869w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-300x231.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-500x386.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-768x592.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Users on the Creator plan are also added to Jetpack&#8217;s &#8220;creator network,&#8221; which appears to be similar to <a href=\"https://convertkit.com/features/creator-network\">ConvertKit&#8217;s creator network</a> with a few differences.

      "content": "\n<p>Adam Schweigert, an independent media and technology consultant, has released a plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/aschweigert/newspack-plugin-update-checker?fbclid=IwAR1Z6GWoPLEQvBBuioWJP7wOxO6lRWgam2f1_2JXyTGeB248b6r1Qv6VOl0#newspack-plugin-update-checker\">Newspack Plugin Update Checker</a> that enables self-hosted Newspack users to keep their plugins up-to-date. The Newspack project was launched in 2019 by WordPress.com, with support from the Google News Initiative, the Knight Foundation, and The Lenfest Institute. It provides local news organizations a powerful, yet cost effective publishing platform that promotes financial sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 200 news sites are on the hosted version of Newspack, which uses WordPress.com&#8217;s cloud platform. Organizations can also host their own Newspack installations independently, which includes a theme, collection of plugins, and blocks. KinshiPress, which publishes news and updates for WordPress publishers, has <a href=\"https://kinshipress.com/newspack-self-hosted/\">a guide to self-hosting Newspack</a> that walks through the process of getting set up. It also mentions the drawback of the plugins being hosted on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Schweigert&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/aschweigert/newspack-plugin-update-checker?fbclid=IwAR1Z6GWoPLEQvBBuioWJP7wOxO6lRWgam2f1_2JXyTGeB248b6r1Qv6VOl0#newspack-plugin-update-checker\">Newspack Plugin Update Checker</a> solves this problem by using a <a href=\"https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker\">plugin updater library</a> that checks for updates and lets users know when a new version is available. The notice appears in the dashboard in a similar way to how WordPress.org displays updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1203\" height=\"107\" data-attachment-id=\"150980\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/newspack-plugin-update-checker-lets-users-update-from-github/image-1-5\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1203,107\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-300x27.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-500x44.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150980\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png 1203w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-300x27.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-500x44.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-768x68.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1203px) 100vw, 1203px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin checks for updates for nine of the most commonly-used Newspack plugins, including the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-plugin\">Newspack Plugin</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-ads\">Newspack Ads</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-blocks\">Newspack Blocks</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-popups\">Newspack Popups (aka Campaigns)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-listings\">Newspack Listings</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-sponsors\">Newspack Sponsors</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-media-partners\">Newspack Media Partners</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-rss-enhancements\">Newspack RSS Enhancements</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-supporters\">Newspack Supporters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Schweigert noted that the plugin requires the Newspack plugins be in folders named using their respective slugs. Although the plugin allows users to enable auto-updates, he recommends keeping an eye on the <a href=\"https://newspack.com/release-notes/\">Newspack release notes</a> to be prepared for any potentially breaking changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KinshiPress author Steve Burge recently published an article on the <a href=\"https://kinshipress.com/newspack-ecosystem/\">Newspack ecosystem</a>, contending that Newspack has the potential to do for publishers what WooCommerce has done for e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s a big audience out for a publishing platform that is open source, highly extendable, and has the backing of a successful company and a strong community,&#8221; Burge said.&#8221; Where else can newspapers, magazines and radio stations go? They mostly go to WordPress already, but the platform we provide them could be much more targeted and helpful.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Schweigert&#8217;s plugin is a good stop gap measure, Burge said he thinks putting the Newspack plugins on WordPress.org and improving the documentation would go a long way towards expanding its impact.</p>\n",

      "slug": "wordpress-theme-handbook-updates-chapter-on-block-templating",
      "content": "\n<p>WordPress contributors have updated the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/\">Theme Handbook</a> to include <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/\">a new chapter on block templating</a>. The chapter covers how the WordPress block template system works, how to build custom templates and parts and include them in a theme. This is critical documentation designed to provide a learning path for those who are building their first block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored developer advocate Justin Tadlock announced the update on Twitter, noting that it also includes a couple of new docs in the Global Settings and Styles chapter for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/custom-templates/\">registering template-related features in theme.json</a>, and the same for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/template-parts/\">template parts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new chapter on block templating is just one part of a larger effort to overhaul the Theme Handbook for modern day WordPress.  Contributors are transitioning the focus from classic theming to block theming, with just one chapter in the handbook devoted to classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was created during a time when classic themes were the only method of front-end design for WordPress,&#8221; Tadlock said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/04/04/theme-handbook-overhaul-proposal/\">proposal to overhaul the handbook</a>. &#8220;Much of its content now exists in a transitory state between classic and modern block theming. This has created a scenario where the handbook sometimes reads more like patchwork than if it were built with a single vision. That is often a natural result of adding new documentation over years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal does not recommend scrapping all of the existing content but rather carrying some of it forward to be updated and reorganized. A good portion of the existing content is still relevant to be migrated to the Classic Themes chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overhauling the Theme Handbook is a colossal effort that&#8217;s still ongoing. It&#8217;s being managed under a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/816\">tracking ticket</a> on GitHub. The new chapter better supports developers who are just figuring out how the WordPress block template system works, but there are many more chapters that need attention. Anyone who would like to get involved in the project can select any issue on the ticket to get started.</p>\n",

      "title": "Add Icons to WordPress&#8217; Core Button Block",
      "slug": "add-icons-to-wordpress-core-button-block",
      "content": "\n<p>Nick Diego, a developer advocate at Automattic and core contributor, is the author of the popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block/\">Icon Block</a> plugin that enables users to add custom SVG icons and graphics to the WordPress block editor. He is often asked if the plugin can add icons to the core Button block, but that is outside the scope of what it does. Last week he wrote a plugin that fulfills this feature request in a separate plugin without building a custom block.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Everyone asks me if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theiconblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theiconblock</a> can add icons to the core Button block in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a>. <br><br>Unfortunately, the answer is no. <br><br>But while traveling last week, I built a little demo plugin that does just that.<br><br>It works quite well, and no need for a custom block 😉… <a href=\"https://t.co/jF3T3T8lOA\">pic.twitter.com/jF3T3T8lOA</a></p>&mdash; Nick Diego (@nickmdiego) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmdiego/status/1719871746818314361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 2, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enable Button Icons plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/ndiego/enable-button-icons\">available on GitHub</a> as an example that demonstrates how developers can lightly extend core blocks for features like this. Diego said he was inspired by WordPress developer Aki Hamano&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/t-hamano/enable-responsive-image#enable-responsive-image\">Enable Responsive Image</a> plugin that adds settings to the Image block to elegantly display different images depending on the width of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"ja\" dir=\"ltr\">WordPressの画像ブロックで、モバイル時に画像を切り替えたいけど、カスタムブロックを作るまでもなくシンプルにコアブロックを拡張するものが欲しいなと思い、試しに作ってみました。<br>とりあえず追加出来る画像は1枚で、ブレークポイントと解像度だけ切り替えられるように。<a href=\"https://t.co/3OeUEQcGqQ\">https://t.co/3OeUEQcGqQ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NxafBGRDfh\">pic.twitter.com/NxafBGRDfh</a></p>&mdash; Aki Hamano / 浜野 哲明 (@tetsuaki_hamano) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tetsuaki_hamano/status/1712763117174956324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to use the WordPress image block to switch images on mobile, but I wanted something that would simply extend the core block without having to create a custom block, so I tried making one,&#8221; Hamano said. &#8220;For now, you can only add one image, and only the breakpoint and resolution can be switched.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Diego said he doesn&#8217;t plan to add his Enable Button Icons plugin to the official WordPress directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It works great, but it is not designed to support an entire library of icons, and I know that will be the first thing people ask for,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So, I&#8217;m thinking of keeping it as an example and encouraging people to take it and modify it as they want.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the plugin and it works perfectly but is certainly ripe for being extended to support a larger selection of icons. Alternatively, it may be useful for a brand that has a set number of custom designed icons they want to be easily accessible for use in Button blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"858\" height=\"610\" data-attachment-id=\"150933\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/add-icons-to-wordpress-core-button-block/image-13\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\" data-orig-size=\"858,610\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-300x213.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-500x355.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150933\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png 858w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-300x213.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-500x355.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-768x546.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego will be running an event at the end of the month about how to extend core WordPress blocks, and the Enable Button Icons plugin will be part of that.

      "slug": "wordfence-cli-2-0-1-update-adds-free-vulnerability-scanning",
      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/10/wordpress-vulnerability-scanning/\">Wordfence CLI 2.0.1</a> introduced free vulnerability scanning this week. The new <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-cli/\">CLI product</a> was <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/08/wordfence-cli/\">launched at WordCamp US</a> two months ago with malware detection capabilities, but the latest update brings in the most highly requested feature &#8211; vulnerability scanning at scale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence is most well-known for its Web Application Firewall, malware scanner, and login security product, which is packaged as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\">a free plugin</a> and installed on more than 4 million websites. The CLI is the first-ever command line malware and vulnerability scanner for WordPress servers. It is targeted at developers, site cleaners who scan large numbers of files for remediation, agencies, and hosting companies that want to scan across entire networks of millions of customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vulnerability scanning in Wordfence CLI 2.0.1 uses our own open vulnerability database,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder said. &#8220;The database itself is completely free for anyone to use, and includes APIs that are open, along with web hooks so that developers can build real-time alerting into their applications. Our mission is to secure the Web, and we think that having an open vulnerability database, with an open source, robust and high performance vulnerability scanner for servers furthers that mission.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability database includes responsible disclosures published by researchers for the benefit of the wider community.<br><br>&#8220;Because most vulnerabilities come from the research community, we believe they are public property,&#8221; Maunder said. &#8220;While some companies do charge for their collection of vulnerabilities, we don’t think it is appropriate to resell public property, which is why we created an open and completely free vulnerability database.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CLI vulnerability scans use the Wordfence Intelligence Vulnerability API feed, which is free for both personal and commercial use. It contains more than 12,250 unique vulnerability records affecting 7,600 plugins and themes. The Wordfence team adds an average of 82 new vulnerabilities per week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2.0.1, code named &#8220;Voodoo Child&#8221; simplifies installation so users no longer have to go to the Wordfence site to get an API key. The tool fetches the API key in the background to make it easier to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence CLI is licensed under the GPLv3 and <a href=\"https://github.com/wordfence/wordfence-cli/\">available on GitHub</a>, along with <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/help/wordfence-cli/\">documentation</a> for installing, configuring, and running the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wordfence CLI is one of those projects where the product roadmap writes itself because there is such an obvious need for a powerful tool like this in the WordPress server administration space,&#8221; Wordfence lead developer Matt Barry said. &#8220;We’re in this for the long haul and will continue to invest heavily in Wordfence CLI, with your guidance.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>WooCommerce is <a href=\"https://woo.com/posts/say-hello-to-woo-com/\">rebranding</a>  to &#8220;Woo,&#8221; a shorter, more playful version of the company name that many customers are already using.  <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce\">Automattic acquired WooCommerce</a> in 2015, along with WooThemes. The open source commerce platform now powers more than 4.4 million live websites, including 33% of the top 1 million online stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebranding extends to the Woo Marketplace, WooExperts program, and all other aspects of the Woo experience. It also includes a migration of WooCommerce.com to the <a href=\"https://woo.com/\">woo.com</a> domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;Woo&#8217; is how many loyal customers have referred to us for years. And now we’re leaning into that name for our company and brand,&#8221; Woo VP of Creative and Communications David Callaway said. &#8220;It’s a fun, punchy name that shows how excited we are to empower success for merchants and developers. Switching to Woo.com is part of this larger strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The move to Woo also allows us to standardize and streamline the names of our products and services. For example, we recently renamed WooCommerce Payments to WooPayments, and we’re gradually changing other product names to support this simplified naming system and better connect our core software, extensions, and programs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Callaway also noted that while Woo is how they refer to the brand and company, WooCommerce is the open-source e-commerce platform for WordPress, Woo&#8217;s core product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woo Express is another recently launched product that already bears the shorter name. During the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-woo-2023-woocommerce-highlights-ai-powered-future-and-continued-core-blockification\">2023 State of the Woo</a>, delivered at WooSesh, the team highlighted a few milestones for Woo Express, the company&#8217;s all-in-one Woo plan hosted on WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. It launched in 2023 as what the team described as “Woo’s biggest bet ever.” Free trials began in April 2023 and by July 2023, Woo Express had more than 1,000 customers. It features a new onboarding flow and store personlization experience for merchants, with a setup guide and recommendation engine powered by an AI-driven assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woo customers will not be affected by the name change, although merchants may see a note about it in their dashboard or emails. No action is required from store owners.</p>\n",

Wrangling the data in a spreadsheet became too cumbersome, so Luehrsen launched <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/\">WP Data Dashboard</a> over the weekend as a &#8220;centralized hub for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data across the WordPress landscape.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new website is currently tracking 6,017 themes hosted on WordPress.org with 250 snapshots. It offers stats and data-based insights for those interested in getting a bird&#8217;s-eye view on themes hosted in the official directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"684\" data-attachment-id=\"150818\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-data-dashboard-tracks-wordpress-org-themes-ecosystem/image-4-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png\" data-orig-size=\"1280,684\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-300x160.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-500x267.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150818\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png 1280w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-300x160.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-500x267.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-768x410.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right now, the WP Data Dashboard has one main function: It crawls the WordPress Theme Repo (API) and crunches the numbers to identify trends,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;With the data stored in my own database, I can analyze and combine it in exciting new ways.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Data Dashboard has two unique stats that are interpretations of the data available. The first is a &#8220;Usage Score,&#8221; which is calculated based on a theme&#8217;s active installs vs. total downloads:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A high score indicates a theme that not only has been downloaded frequently but also remains actively installed on many sites. The score undergoes a significant decay if the proportion of active installs to downloads is low, indicating that while the theme might be frequently downloaded, it&#8217;s not retained by users. This metric provides insight into both the initial appeal of a theme and its lasting utility to users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The second unique stat is a &#8220;Diversity Score,&#8221; which compares the downloads of a single theme author to the overall theme directory (or a tag) and scales that value from 0 to 100:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A high score indicates that downloads are spread across many authors, suggesting a diverse and competitive marketplace.

But only Astra managed to retain its users and remains today as one of the most widely used themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s somewhat surprising is the decline in downloads for the newer default themes. While Twenty-Twenty garnered over 8 million downloads, Twenty Twenty-One managed only 6 million, and Twenty Twenty-Two a mere 3 million.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be related to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contentious-review-process-leads-ollie-theme-to-remove-innovative-onboarding-features-amid-stagnating-block-theme-adoption\">slow adoption</a> of block themes, which still <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11X38e9w86XcgT4tybqfjKhrL0PIbDlIsUEJwLiKtJ7Q/edit#gid=931695972\">appears to be stagnating</a> at the end of October.

It would be even more helpful if Luehrsen could make some of the calculated data available for visitors at a glance, such as 2% of overall theme downloads coming from <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes/tag/full-site-editing\">Full Site Editing</a> tagged themes. There are a lot of ways this data could be visualized with graphs and charts in the future, as the database adds more information over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/wp-data-dashboard\">hosted on GitHub</a> under a GPL license, so anyone can dig deeper into the code to see how it works or submit contributions to extend its capabilities.</p>\n",

This is especially important if your Groups represent distinct &#8216;sections&#8217; of a given page/template.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every block can be renamed with the exception of these four:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>core/block</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>core/template-part</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>core/pattern</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>core/navigation</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>More renaming capabilities have been added in 16.9, including the ability to duplicate and rename patterns, as well as pattern categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44214\">introduces new experimental form and inputs blocks</a> to allow building basic forms. It&#8217;s a feature that has taken many by surprise, as few would have predicted WordPress core would be adding form building. A very early version is available under Gutenberg > Experiments, under the &#8220;Form and input blocks&#8221; experiment setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why has there been no proactive outreach to the many developers of longstanding WordPress form solutions currently used by millions and millions of WordPress sites?&#8221; Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock commented on the PR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It seems like proactive outreach to people who are experts in this space and who could do the most to help drive adoption (beyond comments/search/etc.) would have been a good thing. On many levels. Trying to get them on board with contributing, learning from their shared historical knowledge, and even more important of all&#8230; building on top of it and adopting it instead of introducing a point of more fragmentation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forms feature is still in the very early stages of experimentation, and more information may be published to the November edition of &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/174\">What&#8217;s New For Developers?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other notable highlights from this release include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New media categories: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55236\">Audio and Video</a> for organizing patterns by media type</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55388\">Sort pages by date</a> in the Site Editor&#8217;s page management screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Command Palette now shows <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53539\">block-specific commands as contextual suggestions</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Experiments: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55246\">Added featured image field</a> to the page list</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the release post for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/25/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-9-25-october-2/\">Gutenberg 16.9</a> to see the full changelog and more details on bug fixes and enhancements to performance, tooling, documentation, code quality, and accessibility. </p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The upcoming 6.4 release, expected on November 7, will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">disable attachment pages for new installations</a>. Up until now, WordPress automatically created attachment pages when users upload a file through the media upload system. It has been treated as a special post type that holds information about the file and each attachment is accessible under its own URL. SEO plugins have been redirecting attachment pages for years, as they rarely have any significant purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until WordPress 6.4 was released, WordPress created attachment pages by default for every attachment uploaded,&#8221; WordPress contributor Joost de Valk said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">dev note</a> for this <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57913\">change</a>. &#8220;On the vast majority of sites, these attachment pages don’t add any meaningful information. They do, however, exist, get indexed by search engines, and sometimes even rank in search results, leading to bad results for users and site owners.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no changes to existing sites. They will continue to work as they always have, but new sites will have their attachment pages redirected to the attachment URL. Site admins who want to enable or disable attachment pages can use the new  <code>wp_attachment_pages_enabled</code> database option to control attachment pages&#8217; behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no interface for changing whether a site disables attachment pages, which was somewhat controversial in the comments on the Trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57913\">ticket</a> and the dev note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In light of the WordPress mantra &#8216;decisions, not options,&#8217; we’ve decided against making a setting for this,&#8221; de Valk said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developer Sybre Waaijer mades a case for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/#comment-45721\">giving users an option</a> with an interface for toggling it on or off:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The problem with filtering options is that when another&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;provides the option toggle, the option&nbsp;filter&nbsp;will go against user expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where “decisions, not options” becomes paradoxical because we’re now deciding to set an option while also not giving the option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as plugins fill in this gap, then A) where will plugins put the option (likely on their custom page instead of options-media.php), and B) of the dozens of types of plugins that are in the market to juggle this, who will ultimately be in control of the option?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s a filter, each plugin promises to set a toggle via a simple condition. But since it’s an option, plugins can add an option to filter an option and add an option to toggle the option. It’ll become a source of bugs because of the logical biconditionals (XNOR).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While an interface isn&#8217;t in the cards for WordPress 6.4, and may never be back on the table for consideration, contributors are discussing the possibility of putting this in a core plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Should we not have a core plugin for re-enabling attachment pages on new sites?&#8221; Automattic-sponsored contributor Justin Tadlock said. &#8220;If there’s not going to be a UI for this, then a plugin that’s not buried in a Trac ticket would be ideal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>de Valk agreed this would be a good idea to have a plugin that simply adds a setting to the Options -> Media page. Users likely will not understand the purpose of attachment pages unless they are looking to enable them for a specific, niche use case. A plugin like this would be useful for those who are not able to write the code to change attachment pages&#8217; behavior, as described in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">dev note</a>.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s a lengthy document that collates all the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-4/\">dev notes</a> for important changes that developers will want to review. A few examples include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/17/improvements-to-template-loading-in-wordpress-6-4/\">Improvements to Template Loading in WordPress 6.4</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/17/new-option-functions-in-6-4/\">New option functions in 6.4</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/18/image-loading-optimization-enhancements-in-6-4/\">Image loading optimization enhancements in 6.4</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/21/updates-to-the-html-api-in-6-4/\">Updates to the HTML API in 6.4</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/24/framework-for-storing-revisions-of-post-meta-in-6-4/\">Framework for storing revisions of Post Meta in 6.4</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to these important updates to core, WordPress 6.4 will roll six Gutenberg releases into the core – <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-2-12-july/\">16.2</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/26/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-3-26-july/\">16.3</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/10/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-4-9-august/\">16.4</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-5-23-august/\">16.5</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-6-06-september/\">16.6</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-7-27-september/\">16.7</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Documentation team is looking for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2023/10/25/call-for-volunteers-to-help-with-6-4-end-user-documentation/\">volunteers to assist with updating and revising the End User Documentation</a> on HelpHub.

Texts is a newer company founded in 2020 that creates a centralized inbox for all major messaging platforms, including iMessage, WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, Signal, Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proliferation of messaging apps and inboxes has made responding to communication more complicated than it was in previous years. Most companies would prefer to keep users on their own platforms, but Texts offers a new level of interoperability between messaging apps that doesn&#8217;t require the use of its own servers. The website states that users&#8217; messages never touch Texts&#8217; servers. They are encrypted and sent directly to the messaging platforms. Texts charges a monthly subscription, instead of making money by selling users&#8217; data. It also offers a number of AI-powered features for chat summaries, drafts, and translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s Texts acquisition <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/24/texts-joins-automattic/\">announcement</a> states that the company is moving &#8220;into a fourth market that’s integral to the modern web experience: messaging.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg has been eying the messaging market for years and has previously spoken of his fascination with messaging platforms and their relationship with the independent web. In an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P2qbSMdCvis\">interview with Om Malik</a> at WordCamp Europe 2017, he mentioned that Automattic was experimenting with Telegram’s group broadcasting feature. More recently, it 2020, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-invests-4-6m-in-new-vector-creators-of-the-matrix-open-standard-for-decentralized-communication\">Automattic invested $4.6M in New Vector</a>, a company founded by the creators of <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a>, an open standard that powers decentralized conversations with end-to-end encryption. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texts&#8217; founder, Kishan Bagaria, will take on a new role as Head of Messaging at Automattic and the rest of the 10-person team was retained to continue working on the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to an inquiry about the status of the iOS and Android mobile apps for Texts, a representative from Automattic said the company is currently testing an iOS beta with a subset of users. Android support is on the roadmap. The representative also confirmed there are no plans to change pricing right now but Automattic is considering the addition of a freemium plan in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texts will be expanding its coverage to streamline messages across more platforms. Matrix, Tumblr, and many more integrations are on the roadmap, including Snapchat, Google Messages, and Reddit.</p>\n",

This is the third year OSI has published the survey in collaboration with OpenLogic by Perforce, who has sponsored it in previous years. The organizations will be joined by the Eclipse Foundation for the 2024 edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both users and contributors to open source software are invited to participate in the survey, but the questions are more geared towards organizations using and building open source software. The survey gathers information on technology trends, how open source is being used, challenges, growth areas, and more. The data will be used in the 2024 State of Open Source Report, which will be freely available on the OpenLogic website in early 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The data collected in this survey shines a light on the importance of tracking the evolution of Open Source licenses, especially at a time when those licenses are changing from OSI-approved to proprietary,&#8221; OSI Executive Director Stefano Maffulli said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey is open through November 10, and takes approximately 7-10 minutes to complete.

      "content": "\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/\">LiteSpeed Cache plugin</a>, used on more than four million WordPress sites, has patched an XSS vulnerability in version 5.7. The plugin provides all-in-one site acceleration capabilities, server-level caching, and a collection of optimization features. It is compatible with WordPress multisite, and popular plugins like WooCommerce, bbPress, and Yoast SEO, which may contribute to its popularity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence security researcher István Márton discovered the XSS vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to the LiteSpeed Cache Team on August 14, 2023. The Wordfence <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/10/4-million-wordpress-sites-affected-by-stored-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-lightspeed-cache-plugin/\">advisory</a> describes how the vulnerability might make it possible for an attacker to inject malicious scripts:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘esi’ shortcode in versions up to, and including, 5.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Márton also cautioned that previous versions of WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed shortcodes supplied by unauthenticated commenters to be rendered in certain configurations. All versions since WordPress 5.9 were subject to this vulnerability and if users aren&#8217;t on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/wordpress-6-2-2-security-release/\">a patched version of WordPress</a>, the vulnerability would &#8220;make it possible for unauthenticated attackers to exploit this Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability on vulnerable installations.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>LiteSpeed Cache patched the vulnerability in version 5.7, released to WordPress.org on October 10. Although the update has been available for two weeks, only 30% of the plugin&#8217;s user base is running the latest version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LiteSpeed Cache users are recommended to update to the latest patched version as soon as possible. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/10/4-million-wordpress-sites-affected-by-stored-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-lightspeed-cache-plugin/\">advisory</a> from Wordfence for more details and a full technical analysis.</p>\n",

They are taking the plugin route as an opportunity to add more functionality than would generally be allowed in a WordPress.org-hosted theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister said he plans to make the plugin available on WordPress.org in the future. There are currently 1,062 plugins awaiting review in the queue today, with a wait time of 87 days for an initial review. In the meantime, Ollie Dash can be <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/download/\">downloaded</a> from the Ollie website and can also be found <a href=\"https://github.com/OllieWP/ollie-dash\">on GitHub</a>. Users will be notified in the dashboard when there is an update.</p>\n",

The Israel-based company was set to host its first in-person conference  on November 2, in Berlin, Germany, but has postponed it due to the circumstances following Hamas&#8217; terrorist attack on Israel on October 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Elementor hosted more than 400 meetup events.

Early bird tickets went on sale for 99€ in early October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was postponed shortly after the attacks, with a statement on the DreamWeb page:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>At Elementor we can’t ignore the devastation that has been experienced in Israel over the last few days.

This change may be a deliberate recognition of the majority (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">51.4%</a>) of WordPress users who run the software in a non-English language. WordPress adoption has the most potential for growth in emerging markets and locales where Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese languages are spoken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, Mullenweg has used the State of the Word address to make important announcements, share progress, galvanize the contributor base, and recast the vision for WordPress. As the Gutenberg project is now into Phase 3 focusing on collaboration, I would not be surprised to see a demo of functionality that users can expect to see in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Live attendees will need to reserve a ticket for their seats at the in-person event. A live stream will be available for the vast majority of the WordPress world who will not be able to attend. As in previous SOTW events, anyone will be able to submit questions for the live Q&amp;A portion. The team managing the event plans to release more details in November.</p>\n",

Improvements, such as the standardization of layout and spacing variables (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-parent-2021/issues/105\">#105</a>) and the new Query Filter block (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-mu-plugins/pull/441\">#441</a>), will make it easier to update other areas of WordPress.org to blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated showcase is an invaluable resource for agencies and freelancers who are building sites for clients and need to demonstrate the capabilities of WordPress to scale and serve any industry. It&#8217;s also still <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/\">open for new submissions</a>, which meet the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using WordPress in a unique or innovative way</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Representing a notable organization, government entity, or corporation as an official blog or website</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using modern WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are working to streamline and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-showcase-2022/issues/223\">automate</a> the submission process, although it will still include a manual review.  As this process improves, the showcase will become easier to maintain than it has been in previous years.</p>\n",

      "slug": "kinsta-launches-free-static-site-hosting-for-up-to-100-websites-including-wordpress",
      "content": "\n<p>Kinsta <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/changelog/static-site-hosting/\">launched its static site hosting</a> product today, making a strong entrance into the market with a free tier that is competitive with established solutions from Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Pages. Companies can host up to 100 static sites for free, including static WordPress sites, which Kinsta deploys from its global edge network of more than 300 locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Static sites are those that serve HTML pages, media, and assets like JavaScript and CSS. These are usually more suitable for brochure websites, landing pages, personal portfolios, and other simple sites that don&#8217;t require pages to be dynamically generated by code running on a server. Static sites are generally more performant and secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta&#8217;s free static hosting tier comes with the following features and limitations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 concurrent build/site</li>\n\n\n\n<li>100 sites/company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>600 build minutes/month/company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>100 GB bandwidth/month/company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 GB build size limit/site</li>\n\n\n\n<li>API access</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integration with GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diff-based Uploads</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom domains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free SSL support</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers can host pre-built static sites or sites built with static site generator frameworks that use Node.js. Kinsta has created <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/docs/static-site-hosting/static-site-quick-start-examples/\">quick start example repositories</a> for many popular static site generators, including Astro, Cuttlebelle, Docusaurus, Eleventy, Gatsby, Nuxt, Qwik, React, React with Vite, and VuePress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress users can also deploy static sites to the platform and host it for free by converting an existing site to static. Kinsta published a <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/static-wp-site/\">tutorial</a> on the process for converting a WordPress site using a free plugin. The static hosting can also be used to set up a frontend with any kind of backend or host a headless WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1105\" height=\"1039\" data-attachment-id=\"150366\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/kinsta-launches-free-static-site-hosting-for-up-to-100-websites-including-wordpress/static-wp-add-static-site\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site.png\" data-orig-size=\"1105,1039\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"static-wp-add-static-site\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site-300x282.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site-500x470.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150366\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site.png 1105w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site-300x282.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site-500x470.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site-768x722.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1105px) 100vw, 1105px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can launch a static site to Kinsta&#8217;s infrastructure by deploying from a Git repository hosted by BitBucket, GitHub, or GitLab, selecting a branch, and adding a build command and directory to deploy. Kinsta can detect some static site generators automatically, which makes the process easier. A connection and configuration settings can be managed through the MyKinsta dashboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"935\" data-attachment-id=\"150362\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/kinsta-launches-free-static-site-hosting-for-up-to-100-websites-including-wordpress/kinsta-static-site-build-settings\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings.png\" data-orig-size=\"960,935\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"kinsta-static-site-build-settings\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings-300x292.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings-500x487.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150362\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings.png 960w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings-300x292.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings-500x487.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings-768x748.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta plans to introduce add-ons and other features in the future that might be paid, but is committed to keeping the service and this tier free forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just like with every free product or freemium model, our goal is to spread the word with the help of it and let users try out our service, the dashboard in a frictionless way and host a project here for completely free,&#8221; Kinsta Chief Business Officer Tom Zsomborgi said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ability of using and testing out a platform and getting first hand experience is the ultimate way of forming an opinion about a provider. We let everyone use the service and host their projects. If the developers and agencies like the Static product we hope they will consider us for their other web projects and start using the paid services.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta is targeting enterprises, agencies, and companies that need to create websites and landing pages for high-traffic campaigns. The company is working on more features for static site hosting, including the following on the roadmap:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wildcardless domains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extended Kinsta API support</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serverless functions, which could be utilized by static sites</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Previews</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintenance mode</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Password protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability for HTML Forms to work</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More builders</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a build template</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detailed Analytics</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta&#8217;s static site hosting solution is similar to what the competition offers for building and deploying sites, but Zsomborgi said he thinks that having application, database, and WordPress hosting all under one roof sets them apart. Kinsta also offers analytics for free and unlimited users/seats, the same as Vercel, but Netlify only offers these under paid plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The biggest things that we are missing are functions (Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages have them) and deploy previews,&#8221; Zsomborgi said. &#8220;Both of those are in the backlog and will be released soon.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>WordPress 6.4 is one step closer to prime time with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/wordpress-6-4-release-candidate-1/\">RC1 available today</a>. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes-6-4/\">dev notes</a> are rolling out with details on technical improvements in the upcoming release &#8211;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/15/introducing-block-hooks-for-dynamic-blocks/\">block hooks for dynamic blocks</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/17/improvements-to-template-loading-in-wordpress-6-4/\">improvements to template loading</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">changes to attachment pages</a>, and many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RC1 is ready for another round of testing. There are <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;changetime=10%2F12%2F2023..10%2F17%2F2023&amp;milestone=6.4&amp;col=id&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;order=id\">40 additional closed Trac tickets</a> since 6.4 Beta 4, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.4\">dozens of GitHub commits</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyfour/commits/\">commits for Twenty Twenty-Four</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the flagship font library feature had to be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-font-library-feature-punted-to-6-5-release\">punted to 6.5</a> due to gaps in the Font APIs that couldn&#8217;t be resolved in time, the upcoming release is still packed with new features and improvements. A few highlights include a new lightbox functionality, redesigned command palette, block hooks, expanded design tools, and a new default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release candidate phase marks the hard string freeze where no new strings can be added so that the Polyglots team can ensure WordPress 6.4 gets translated. At this point, only regressions introduced during this development cycle and expansions to the test suite can be addressed in the 6.4 milestone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and plugin developers are encouraged to test their extensions against the release candidate. Plugin authors are also advised to update the<em>“Tested up to”</em> version in their readme files to 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second RC is expected next week.

      "content": "\n<p>Adam Zieliński, creator of WordPress Playground, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamzielin/status/1714311403849363944\">announced</a> today that the WordPress Core PR previewer is now live. Playground is an experimental project that uses WebAssembly (WASM) to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-prototype-runs-wordpress-in-the-browser-with-no-php-server\">run WordPress in the browser</a>. It creates a WordPress instance with admin access without having to install PHP, MySQL, or Apache, making it nearly instantaneous to fire up a test site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing pull requests is one of the most exciting use cases for the Playground project. The newly launched WordPress Core PR previewer can be found at <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/wordpress.html\">playground.wordpress.net/wordpress.html</a>. Users can enter the PR number or the URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2332\" height=\"1298\" data-attachment-id=\"150303\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/preview-wordpress-core-pull-requests-with-playground/screen-shot-2023-10-17-at-4-10-46-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2332,1298\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-300x167.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-500x278.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150303\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM.png 2332w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-300x167.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-500x278.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-768x427.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-1536x855.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM-2048x1140.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2332px) 100vw, 2332px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/pull/700\">PR for for previewing wordpress-develop repository pull pequests</a> adds support for a few query parameters that developers can use to customize how the preview loads:<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/205419/274972437-e30e9ac6-c99e-4e81-b68f-45e14116f6c9.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>?pr=5481</code>&nbsp;– preview that PR</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>?url=/wp-admin/post-new.php</code>&nbsp;– load that URL in WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>?mode=seamless</code>&nbsp;– redirect to a full-screen Playground without the browser chrome and any other extra UI elements</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Zieliński identified a couple of known issues with this first implementation that developers should be aware of when working with the previewer: Existing PRs need a rebase to work but new PRs work just fine. Additionally, if you test it out, you will find that downloading WordPress may take a long time, as the bundle is ~45MB. Contributors are working on finding a way to optimize this so that it&#8217;s quicker and more efficient to preview PRs. Any problems or bugs can be reported to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues\">Playground repository&#8217;s issues</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/696\">Playground roadmap</a>, Zieliński is working on making <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/696\">a pull request previewer for all WordPress projects</a>, not just core, as he outlined in a planning issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Previewing WordPress Pull Requests requires either a local development setup or a staging setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developers often use either a staging environment that can only run a single branch at a time, or no staging environment at all. This makes testing and team workflows difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing an easy way to preview pull requests using Playground would alleviate that burden, catalyze more reviews across the ecosystem, and make calls for testing easier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress meta contributors recently implemented a “Live Preview” button for plugins in the official directory but ended up <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-reverts-live-preview-button-on-plugins-after-developer-backlash\">reverting it after many plugins were broken</a> due to inadequate support in the Playground environment.  Zieliński and contributors are  still refining the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/662\">live preview experience for plugins</a> hosted on WordPress.org, and are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/664\">creating a Blueprints API</a> that will be easy for developers to use for customizing their Playground instances.</p>\n",

If the user doesn&#8217;t manually set an overlay color prior to uploading the image, the code extracts the overlay color by computing the average color of the image. Automattic-sponsored core contributor Vicente Canales included a video, which demonstrates how expertly the block selects the most complimentary overlay color:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/feature-dominant-color.mp4\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">video credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/11/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-8-11-october/\">Gutenberg 16.8 release post</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Work on the Font Library continues, even though the feature was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-font-library-feature-punted-to-6-5-release\">punted to WordPress 6.5</a>. Gutenberg 16.8 moves font uploads to a new Upload tab, improves error messaging, and removes the use of snackbar.

Users can test it by enabling the &#8220;New admin views&#8221; experiment under Gutenberg > Experiments. The experiment can be found in the site editor by navigating to <code>Pages->Manage all pages</code>. The list is paginated and there are options to sort and filter it.

It&#8217;s a growing resource that exists to provide free, publicly-contributed, CC0-licensed photographs. Every photo submitted is moderated by a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m super excited about this milestone,&#8221; Photos team moderator Michelle Frechette said. &#8220;Most (if not all) of the moderators are also photographers, and we appreciate the photography skills and the time it takes for people to take, edit, and submit a photo. It’s really fulfilling to see the numbers grow and include so many people and their art.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the images included in the directory are also available through Openverse, which aggregates various media sources. One distinction about the directory is that it accepts user submissions from anyone &#8211; they don&#8217;t have to be professional-level photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The fact that there are now over 10,000 photos in the directory that folks can use &#8211; completely attribution-free &#8211; is incredible,&#8221; Photos team moderator Marcus Burnette said. &#8220;What I love even more, though, is that there are 1400+ contributors that make up that number! While submitting a photo is simple, often times composing, taking, and editing a photo is not. I appreciate everyone who has taken the time to make the directory as high-quality as it is.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selections from the WordPress Photos Directory were featured as hanging prints in the Open Source | Open Canvas art gallery at WordCamp US 2023.

Photos getting rejected are usually not following the guidelines (ex: human face in the photo, private info like a license plate in image), or are not high enough quality (ex: low resolution, crooked horizon.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moderating photos only takes a minute or two on average and the queue has been fairly manageable. The moderators use various checks to ensure photos are high quality and original, include accurate alt text, cross-check subject tags, and add the main colors of the image. In some cases, when a submission is rejected, moderators will email asking them to correct the issues and re-submit. Most photos are moderated within two to three business days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a photo moderator after starting as someone who submits photos, is one of the natural paths many contributors have taken to joining the team. It&#8217;s one of the many opportunities to contribute back to the open source project without writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some of my photos were the first to seed the directory for the announcement and launch, which was a huge honor,&#8221; Frechette said. &#8220;Becoming a moderator and helping others submit their photos is really fulfilling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Although it doesn’t always make you happy to decline a photo, it’s helping the project be competitive and high quality, and oftentimes a photographer can make a small tweak (like blurring a license plate or leveling a horizon) and then re-submit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve learned a ton about the world and the WordPress community &#8211; and about what they love &#8211; by moderating photos.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:33px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-4 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" data-attachment-id=\"150194\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/behind-the-lens-wordpress-photos-directory-surpasses-10000-images-moderators-explore-future-enhancements/40064ff8de0c50228-88755667-1536x2048-1\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/40064ff8de0c50228.88755667-1536x2048-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\\&quot;https:\\/\\/wordpress.org\\/photos\\/photo\\/40064ff8de\\/\\&quot;

Photos Directory a More Competitive Resource for CC0 Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The photo moderators have many ideas for making the directory a more competitive resource for CC0 photos but currently do not have quantifiable ways to measure the growth in traffic and usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As far as I know, we (the moderators) don’t have access to any traffic data,&#8221; Burnette said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’d love to see the directory more prominently featured as a source of media inside WordPress core. In addition, having some access to stats (search queries, traffic patterns, photo downloads) would give us a better view of where we are and how to focus our future growth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the promotion for the directory has happened during photo walks at WordCamps and contributor tables where photographers are trained to understand what makes a good photo, how the process works, and moderate as many as they can that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There has been some promotion on Twitter through official WordPress channels, but I’d love to see some of these images used in the yearly themes and in the block pattern directory,&#8221; moderator Chuck Grimmett said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Another thing we are missing is easy selection in the block editor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have a few different sources to select from, depending on whether they have plugins like Jetpack installed that add more. All of the WordPress Photo Directory images are included in Openverse, but searching for CC0 images from the WordPress directory itself is not an option. Grimmett opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55286\">ticket</a> on GitHub to put the idea on contributors&#8217; radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:22px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1332\" height=\"860\" data-attachment-id=\"150189\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/behind-the-lens-wordpress-photos-directory-surpasses-10000-images-moderators-explore-future-enhancements/image-12\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.png\" data-orig-size=\"1332,860\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-300x194.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-500x323.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150189\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.png 1332w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-300x194.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-500x323.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-768x496.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1332px) 100vw, 1332px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest hurdles to expanding the volume of the directory is that images that include human faces are prohibited from getting listed in the collection. This is a a legal requirement that the team would have to work out with legal council to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’ve attempted to get this cleared on several occasions over the last year or two,&#8221; Burnette said. &#8220;The legal hurdle seems to be quite large to allow for this, so the status of that is in a holding pattern.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, nature is the most popular category with more than 6,000 images. Athletics is the least popular, as it&#8217;s not easy to get great photos without the faces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We do not have access to the searches that folks are making, so it’s hard to know what people are looking for specifically,&#8221; Burnette said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Something that no doubt is searched for frequently is corporate type images (offices, desk setups, meetings, etc) and we don’t have a ton of those &#8211; likely also due in part to the requirement about not including human faces.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:27px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1862\" height=\"926\" data-attachment-id=\"150187\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/behind-the-lens-wordpress-photos-directory-surpasses-10000-images-moderators-explore-future-enhancements/cleanshot-2023-10-11-at-15-11-502x\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1862,926\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x-300x149.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x-500x249.jpg\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150187\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x.jpg 1862w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x-300x149.jpg 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x-500x249.jpg 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x-768x382.jpg 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-11-at-15.11.50@2x-1536x764.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1862px) 100vw, 1862px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Another big thing is search,&#8221; Photo moderator Topher DeRosia said. &#8220;Early on in the project, and sometimes even now, the alt text is not great, and tags aren&#8217;t well thought out, so a keyword search may not find what we&#8217;re really looking for.  I&#8217;d love for a set of skilled moderators to review all 10,000 photos and make the alt text amazing. I think a really good AI search tool that can look at the images and try to get it right might be a great inclusion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photos Directory project is a unique contribution opportunity that gives moderators a glimpse into the beauty of things and places around the world that photographers were inspired to capture and submit. The fact that the images are available inside the WordPress editor makes it more than just another collection of photos on the web. It&#8217;s an important, growing resource that showcases the creative lives of contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I added the incoming stream to my RSS reader, so I&#8217;ve literally laid eyes on every single image in there, whether I moderated it or not,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;Because of this I&#8217;ve seen photos from everyplace in the world that WordPressers have submitted them, and that&#8217;s a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned that we have some amazingly talented photographers in the community.  I&#8217;ve learned about geography and history.  I&#8217;ve also met some new and wonderful people. As always, contribution pays great dividends.&#8221;<a href=\"https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T024MFP4J-F061ET96XCG/cleanshot_2023-10-11_at_16.25.28_2x.png\"></a></p>\n",

      "slug": "wordpress-com-enters-the-fediverse-with-activitypub-support",
      "content": "\n<p>WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/11/activitypub/\">added support for ActivityPub</a> today, a decentralized social networking protocol that is now available for across free and paid plans. This allows users to join the fediverse from their WordPress.com sites, and interact with content across federated platforms like Mastodon (and many others) with replies automatically published back to the blog as comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/activitypub-1-0-0-released-introducing-blog-wide-accounts-and-new-blocks\">latest version</a> of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\">ActivityPub plugin</a> for WordPress allows blogs or sites to have their own ActivityPub profile. (Previously, profiles were limited to individual authors). Automattic acquired the plugin in March 2023, from German developer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/pfefferle/\">Matthias Pfefferle</a> who joined the company and has continued to improve it and add new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practically speaking, this new ActivityPub support allows fediverse users to follow participating WordPress.com blogs on their chosen service, and comment on the content with those comments synced back to the blog &#8211; all without leaving their federated platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com users can activate ActivityPub support under <em>Settings > Discussion</em>. They also have the option to use a custom domain for a shorter, more memorable identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once activated, ActivityPub support is available on new posts only &#8211; it is not retroactive. There may also be a delay in short delay for newly published posts appearing on federated platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One WordPress.com user asked &#8220;When will WordPress Reader be able to follow Fediverse accounts?&#8221; This isn&#8217;t yet on the roadmap, based on the response from WordPress.com representatives, but may now be on their radar for future improvements to ActivityPub support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin and its addition to WordPress.com marks a significant expansion for the availability of ActivityPub interoperability, as support can now be effortlessly added for WordPress.com sites in addition to self-hosted sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said Tumbler would add support for ActivityPub but this has not yet materialized and a current Tumblr employee said in July 2023, that they are <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@_jv_@mastodon.social/110692572899315822\">still evaluating it</a> but that it may cost more than it&#8217;s worth to the company. It may have become a lower priority, as Tumblr doesn&#8217;t appear to be in a position to embrace new projects that don&#8217;t generate cash flow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adoption of the ActivityPub protocol has been slow moving and has not yet delivered the avalanche of new users that Twitter/X has practically gift wrapped with its many unfavorable changes and, most recently, its laughable <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/elon-musk-x-twitter-news-links-headlines-why.html\">treatment of external links</a>, which is an affront to the open web. Blogging pioneer and podcaster Dave Winer, who has watched social networks come and go, is not banking on ActivityPub and believes &#8220;<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/10/10/114018.html\">the world will not coalesce behind ActivityPub</a>&#8221; in its search for a standard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are already active on fediverse platforms that support ActivityPub, WordPress.com&#8217;s new features may be useful for ensuring that blogs can meaningfully participate there. It&#8217;s a quick and easy way to allow more people to follow WordPress sites and give their content further reach into the fediverse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future adoption of the ActivityPub protocol across more apps and platforms remains to be proven. In July, when Threads announced it would support the protocol, Mastodon CEO Eugen Rochko said in a <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/\">blog post</a>, &#8220;The fact that large platforms are adopting ActivityPub is not only validation of the movement towards decentralized social media but a path forward for people locked into these platforms to switch to better providers.&#8221; Although this wider network of ActivityPub support gives users more choice about the platforms they use to communicate, the evolution of the social media landscape is still volatile and unpredictable, leaving many people with the burden of hedging their bets by interacting across multiple networks while waiting for the dust to settle.</p>\n",

      "title": "WordPress Contributors Speed Up Twenty Twenty-Four Default Theme Performance by 40%",
      "slug": "wordpress-contributors-speed-up-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme-performance-by-40",
      "content": "\n<p>WordPress 6.4 will be shipping a new default theme, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-unveils-design-for-upcoming-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a> (TT4), expected in early November. This theme is more feature-rich than previous default themes, and contributors have been working on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59465\">identifying potential performance improvements</a> that can be made ahead of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a starting point, Google-sponsored Performance team contributor Felix Arntz conducted several benchmarks comparing TT4 with the TT3 block theme. These included overall Web Vitals covering both server-side (TTFB) and client-side (LCP-TTFB), along with a separate server-side load time performance benchmark. Arntz posted a summary of this data:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<ul>\n<li>For the home page:\n<ul>\n<li>Overall load time (LCP) is 58.8% slower. 🔴</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Client-side performance (LCP-TTFB) is 93.5% slower. 🔴</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Server-Timing (<code>wp-total</code>) is 71.8% slower. 🔴</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For the singular post:\n<ul>\n<li>Overall load time (LCP) is 3.9% slower. 🔴</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Client-side performance (LCP-TTFB) is 40.1% faster. 🟢</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Server-Timing (<code>wp-total</code>) is 42.3% slower. 🔴</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted that the reason TT4 is slower is because it provides a lot more feature rich content out of the box than TT3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Interestingly, the server-side performance difference between TT4 and TT3 seems to come almost exclusively from the number of block editor features used by the theme, but not by any problems from the theme itself,&#8221; Arntz said. &#8220;In fact, the theme only includes a single function of PHP logic. It does however include more complex content than TT3 and comes with a large number of patterns, so potentially that plays a role there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After just two weeks of work on specific tickets for a few flagged issues, performance contributors were able to make the new Twenty Twenty-Four theme (and other themes) load more than 40% faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am very excited to report that most (if not all) of the server-side performance concerns have been addressed, via additional general performance fixes that landed in core,&#8221; Arntz said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He summarized the improvements in the server-timing benchmarks when comparing TT4 and TT3 with the latest core trunk:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<ul>\n<li>TT4 home page loads in 85.91ms, compared to 78.08ms in TT3.\n<ul>\n<li>→&nbsp;<strong>10.0% slower, but before was 71.8% slower</strong>&nbsp;🎉</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TT4 &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; post loads in 96.44ms, compared to 86.35ms in TT3.\n<ul>\n<li>→&nbsp;<strong>11.7% slower, but before was 42.3% slower</strong>&nbsp;🎉</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few outstanding client-side performance enhancements, but Arntz said these require more thought and time investment so they have been milestoned for the 6.5 release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/wordpress-6-4-beta-3/\">WordPress 6.4 Beta 3</a> was released yesterday. Although the flagship Font Library feature has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-font-library-feature-punted-to-6-5-release\">punted to 6.5</a>, contributors said this change will not affect Twenty Twenty-Four, as the theme will ship with preselected fonts that get loaded from the theme assets, just like previous default themes.</p>\n",

This year’s theme is “Next Generation Commerce,&#8221; featuring advances across the e-commerce industry, as well as WooCommerce core and the wider ecosystem of tools and payment integrations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce CEO Paul Maiorana began the presentation with a few stats on Woo&#8217;s growth in 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>4.4M+ live websites currently using WooCommerce (<a href=\"https://storeleads.app/\">StoreLeads.app</a> Woo usage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>33% of the top 1 million online store are powered by Woo </li>\n\n\n\n<li>8.9% of the internet is powered by Woo (<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-woocommerce\">W3Techs</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>270M+ Woo downloads to date (WooCommerce internal data)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>908 products in the Marketplace</li>\n\n\n\n<li>66 languages supported</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Maiorana highlighted a few e-commerce trends the company is watching, including the expansion of chatbots, on-site search, and AR. WooCommerce is seeing more merchants attracting non-local buyers through cross-boarder selling strategies, with high-growth stores focused on expanding across countries, languages, channels, and payment methods. Maiorana said customers are now expecting seamless experiences across devices and store must be fast, smooth, and intuitive from screen to screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maiorana also shared insights from <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/partner-program/\">WooExperts</a>, officially endorsed WooCommerce agencies, who are seeing an increase in merchants embracing multi-channel selling, diversified payment options, and immersive buying experience that leverage AI, AR, virtual try-ons, and 3D images.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1178\" data-attachment-id=\"150047\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-woo-2023-woocommerce-highlights-ai-powered-future-and-continued-core-blockification/screen-shot-2023-10-10-at-12-13-52-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2100,1178\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-300x168.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-500x280.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150047\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM.png 2100w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-500x280.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-768x431.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-1536x862.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-2048x1149.png 2048w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.13.52-PM-640x360.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of the Woo featured several milestones WooCommerce logged this year. WooCommerce Payments is now available in 38 countries. WooPay, the gateway&#8217;s opt-in single-click cross-site checkout experience, is out of beta. WooCommerce has also continued expanding its payment integrations covering more geographies and localized payment methods. The company recently launched <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/tiktok-for-woocommerce/\">TikTok for WooCommerce</a> as a new integration to help merchants improve conversion by selling directly via TikTok Shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooExperts onboarded 88 new agencies, who are ambassadors for Woo, building enterprise projects at scale. They are also invited to collaborate with WooCommerce on technical planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce core has crossed several important milestones in 2023, including making High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS), more commonly known as custom order tables, the default on <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/10/10/woocommerce-8-2-0-released/\">version 8.2</a>. This major overhaul delivers significant performance gains and makes databases more scalable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full blockification of WooCommerce core is on the way <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/roadmap/block-based-product-creation-experience/\">a new product management experience using the Blocks API</a>. It was auto-enabled for a subset of new stores in 7.9, released in July, and will be enabled for more stores as soon as WooCommerce adds variable product management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based order confirmation is next on the roadmap, and block-based cart and checkout will soon be the default, as WooCommerce is working closely with partners to increase extension support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Woo Express: More AI-Powered Features Coming Soon</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2440\" height=\"1242\" data-attachment-id=\"150061\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-woo-2023-woocommerce-highlights-ai-powered-future-and-continued-core-blockification/screen-shot-2023-10-10-at-12-32-27-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2440,1242\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-300x153.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-500x255.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150061\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM.png 2440w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-300x153.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-500x255.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-768x391.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-1536x782.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.32.27-PM-2048x1042.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2440px) 100vw, 2440px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During today&#8217;s WooSesh keynote, WooCommerce also highlighted a few milestones for Woo Express, the all-in-one WooCommerce plan hosted on WordPress.com. The product launched in 2023 as &#8220;Woo&#8217;s biggest bet ever.&#8221; It kicked off in September 2022, launched free trials in April 2023, and had 1,000 paying customers as of July 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team demonstrated the new onboarding flow and store personalization experience. Woo Express&#8217; current priorities are making store setup easier with an AI-driven assistant to guide merchants through setup and growing stores, along with offering smart recommendations to drive more revenue, based on store analytics. The product defaults to a block-based theme, cart, and checkout. It includes the Woo AI plugin for early feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woo Express is currently only available on WordPress.com, but WooCommerce representatives said what its features will also be surfaced in Woo core. The product is being used as a proving ground for the next phases of product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:22px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2056\" height=\"1132\" data-attachment-id=\"150059\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-woo-2023-woocommerce-highlights-ai-powered-future-and-continued-core-blockification/screen-shot-2023-10-10-at-12-31-30-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2056,1132\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-300x165.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-500x275.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150059\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM.png 2056w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-300x165.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-500x275.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-768x423.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-1536x846.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-10-at-12.31.30-PM-2048x1128.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2056px) 100vw, 2056px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\">WooSesh</a> will be live again tomorrow with more sessions on using AI tools for support, creating effective landing pages, using Amazon Pay, shipping trends, case studies, and more.

The button went live across all of WordPress.org&#8217;s 59,000+ plugins but took plugin developers by surprise as it was pushed through without any communication or input from stakeholders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementation was premature and failed to take into consideration the many different types of plugins that appear to be broken due to inadequate support in the Playground testing environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five weeks ago, Automattic-sponsored Meta team contributor Steve Dufresne <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2023-09-07T00%3A29%3A45Z&amp;precision=second\">commented</a> on the ticket, &#8220;Adding that it&#8217;s likely still the case (someone else can confirm), not all plugins work in the Playground so we should build in an opt-out mechanism.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This suggestion was roundly ignored by other participants on the ticket and the Playground previews went live. It became immediately apparent that this was done without thorough testing as many plugin authors reported the previews created an unfavorable, broken experience for users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Who decided to release Preview without posting on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/\">make.wordpress.org/plugins/</a> with some advanced warning to plugin devs?&#8221; WordPress developer Alan Fuller asked, starting a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1696523391533419\">discussion</a> in the #meta Slack channel. &#8220;Was that a #meta decision? Can it be reverted and due notice given?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retired Plugins team rep Mika Epstein identified three major use cases that were missed, which she estimates will impact 30-40% of plugins not working in the Playground environment: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>It won’t work for add-on plugins (ie. anything for Woo) because we have no way to identify plugin dependancies, and the sandbox won’t know to install the ‘parent’ plugin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won’t work (well) for anything that requires a lot of customization (WooCommerce itself)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won’t work AT ALL for anything that’s a server integration (Memcached, Redis, etc).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multisite</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants noted that DEBUG is also set to True, allowing unrelated warnings and notices to be displayed to the visitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It stinks to work really hard on a plugin and then have some preview show up that makes it look totally broken when it&#8217;s not,&#8221; WordPress developer Ben Sibley said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This feature is a neat idea, but it needs a lot more work. We&#8217;ve gone decades without live previews; why was there suddenly a rush to launch this today when it&#8217;s demonstrably unreliable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As others have stated, this should be rolled back immediately and switched to an opt-in feature. Once it&#8217;s rolled back, work on giving plugin devs information about how the preview works so we can decide if it&#8217;s right for us or not. There is no rush to release this without proper communication and testing!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newsletter Glue co-founder Lesley Sim requested the feature be opt-in, contending that the average user won&#8217;t have patience if something appears broken and will assume there is a problem with the plugin, not the directory or the playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So it ends up reflecting badly on the plugin developer, which can be really stressful for them if it means a loss in (potential) revenue/installs (yes, I understand that many people think this shouldn&#8217;t be a key concern, but it is the reality for many small plugin devs) or if they have additional support burden as a result of this feature, which is completely out of their hands,&#8221; Sim said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After others echoed these concerns, Automattic-sponsored contributor Alex Shiels, who implemented the feature, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2023-10-06T02%3A26%3A06Z&amp;precision=second\">said</a> he didn&#8217;t expect it would be controversial and <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1696571100525509?thread_ts=1696523391.533419&amp;cid=C02QB8GMM\">said</a> he was &#8220;over-optimistic about how smoothly it would work.&#8221; He deployed a commit that <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12933\">added an opt-out toggle</a> so plugin committers could disable the Live Preview button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason I didn’t communicate prior to deploy is, there was discussion on the ticket for a month prior; and because Playground has been live for several months now,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;Every published plugin in the directory has already been available for running in the Playground since well before this ticket. All I did was make it easy to get there with a single click. Apologies for catching you all off-guard.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others requested WordPress.org implement a customizable Demo link url in the readme file, instead of turning Playground previews on for all plugins, along with many more suggestions for making the environment better for showcasing  plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After continued pushback urging Shiels to make the feature opt-in instead of opt-out, he <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12934\">removed the button</a> on Friday, October 6. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I do want to emphasize that a lot of the worry and concern wasn’t about the fact that a plugin was broken in Playground,&#8221; plugin developer Aurooba Ahmed said. &#8220;Most of us know if our plugin works in playground or not, it was that a very apparent feature was pushed to the plugin repo that affects how users evaluate plugins, without discussion and feedback from enough of the key stakeholder audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I look forward to seeing how the feature is iterated upon (because ultimately it’s a fantastic concept) so that it can be useful in all the right ways for all stakeholders.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, users who enjoy having quick access to Playground may want to check out the Chrome browser extension created by LUBUS, a development agency. It <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-chrome-browser-extension-enables-one-click-plugin-and-theme-testing-with-wordpress-playground\">adds a Playground” button to theme and plugin pages</a> on WordPress.org so users can test drive extensions with one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When adding the opt-out toggle, Shiels commented on the ticket that plugins broken in Playground were broken before the ticket was opened and will remain that way even if the plugin does not opt into the Live Preview button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I know the Playground team is hard at work on addressing bugs and compatibility issues there,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;And I intend to further improve the Live Preview support in the plugin directory to make things better for users and plugin developers alike. Many of your concerns can be addressed using <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/blueprints-api/index\">Blueprints</a> which will allow configuring and installing dependencies, importing demo content, and other neat things. I&#8217;ll work on making Blueprint support available as soon as I&#8217;ve confirmed some engineering details with the Playground team.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is more work to be done before this feature is ready for rollout. The live preview button is currently disabled while contributors iron out compatibility issues.</p>\n",

While it was awesome to see that kind of support, by this point it had become clear that it was too controversial to try this right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were valid concerns that without a system or understanding in place at the directory level, this could set a precedent with unknown outcomes and potentially burden volunteers with longer theme review queues. We don’t want that, and the idea that a feature of Ollie would burden anyone is <em>the antithesis</em> of our aim of helping users through this exciting era of modern WordPress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie&#8217;s creators are working on putting the onboarding into a plugin in order to &#8220;deliver our original vision, free of constraints.&#8221; It will be available on GitHub and they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1710050878042821071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1710050878042821071%7Ctwgr%5Eb107394162dfda43307002c16128506f013147ff%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D149955action%3Dedit\">plan to submit it to WordPress.org</a>, but the severe backlog may prevent it from being live in the directory for a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme on WordPress.org has more hurdles to getting started with a new website. Users will need to know how to navigate the Site Editor to edit templates and place patterns. After installing the theme, it&#8217;s painfully clear how much simpler the onboarding wizard would make everything. Ollie comes with seven full-page pattern layouts, which helps if you want to build a site similar to the demo. It also packages seven style variations and an astonishing 50 custom block patterns for building nearly any kind of website.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2842\" height=\"1296\" data-attachment-id=\"149968\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/ollie-theme-now-available-on-wordpress-org/screen-shot-2023-10-06-at-9-22-42-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2842,1296\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-300x137.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-500x228.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149968\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM.png 2842w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-300x137.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-500x228.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-768x350.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-1536x700.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-06-at-9.22.42-PM-2048x934.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2842px) 100vw, 2842px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With different combinations of patterns, Ollie is suitable for personal websites, agencies, portfolios, nonprofit organizations, blogs, and businesses of various kinds.

After a lengthy process, which required 18 months of active web development, data migration, and content building, NASA has emerged with modernized flagship and science websites, showcasing the innovation and discoveries that have defined the agency for more than 65 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The multi-million dollar project began a few years ago when a combination of the IDEA Act and Drupal 7 EOL provided an opportunity for NASA to reconsider the CMS they were using for nasa.gov. <a href=\"https://lonerockpoint.com/\">Lone Rock Point</a>, a WordPress.com VIP Gold Agency Partner, led the project, which began with  a year of UX design and an evaluation of various enterprise CMS&#8217;s that would ultimately end up supporting 456 CMS users, 68,698 migrated pages, and 3,023 new landing pages. As part of the project, NASA&#8217;s website infrastructure was migrated from an Amazon Web Services environment to WordPress.com VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In earlier discovery phases of the project, content authors were were vocal that they were interested in a CMS that allowed them to break free of templates that were perceived to be rigid,&#8221; Lone Rock Point President J.J. Toothman said. &#8220;The block based authoring approach of Gutenberg is delivering on that and user testing showed that WordPress could provide that. Now that the site is live, the different types of landing pages being created with block based approach further validates that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA evaluated both proprietary and open source solutions, and Toothman said they took a high level look at over a hundred CMS platforms. They narrowed it down to four CMS&#8217;s &#8211; two were commercial and two were open source (WordPress and Drupal). The team completed high level prototyping and user evaluation on all four of the finalists, and used this data in the CMS selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toothman outlined a few of the factors that set WordPress apart from the others:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Access to resources. Simply put, there’s a huge community around WordPress. That community is extending WordPress in innovative ways; sharing knowledge and training for WordPress; and continuously building up WordPress skills amongst the community. That makes it easier for an organization like NASA to acquire support. There’s options for that. What was found with commercial CMS solutions is that, more often than not, NASA would have to go back to the original CMS vendor to find resources. That’s limited flexibility, which is undesirable for them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A plugin ecosystem that delivered real time content analysis capabilities within the WordPress admin environment in the ares of SEO and accessibility. The fact that content could be analyzed by the author before it was published was significant.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ease of use of the content authoring environment</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s a big win for open source,&#8221; Toothman said. &#8220;There were a number of CMS capabilities that would have been more time consuming to implement without previous work by others in the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He cited the  integration that the NASA WordPress site has with NASA’s image library at <a href=\"http://images.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">images.nasa.gov</a> as one example. Content authors in the CMS can search for images in the library and include them in their content via an augmentation that was made to the WordPress media library. Human Made did some previous work with commercial digital asset management solutions that NASA was able to leverage for the <a href=\"http://images.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">images.nasa.gov</a> integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">NASA Goes All In on WordPress&#8217; Block Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor&#8217;s flexibility for authoring landing pages and breaking free of a rigid templating system was one of the most important factors in NASA&#8217;s selection of WordPress as a CMS. As part of the project, Lone Rock Point created 55 custom editor blocks to help NASA website authors share discoveries and tell their stories.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1692\" height=\"1080\" data-attachment-id=\"149949\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/why-nasa-chose-wordpress-for-revamping-its-flagship-website/tabbed-content-block\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tabbed-content-block.gif\" data-orig-size=\"1692,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tabbed-content-block\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tabbed-content-block-300x191.gif\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tabbed-content-block-500x319.gif\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tabbed-content-block.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149949\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">NASA&#8217;s Tabbed Content block &#8211; source: <a href=\"https://lonerockpoint.com/2023/10/nasa-flagship-wordpress-site-launch/\">Lone Rock Point</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s over 400 content authoring/editor users in NASA’s WordPress CMS,&#8221; Toothman said. &#8220;With that many users, there’s a lot of variance in pre-existing familiarity to WordPress and Gutenberg. It was challenging. The learning curve was more significant than expected and change management was a big part of this project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some took the block editor quickly, others needed more support. It wasn’t just learning the mechanics of a new CMS, but learning about the storytelling options available via the new design system and the block editor. We built a lot of custom of blocks to bring the design system to live in WordPress, while also attempting to adhere to the intention of those design system components.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toothman and his team found strategic ways of helping new block editor users become familiar with the authoring tools. They created hands-on training and working sessions to build pages in real time alongside users and created an online knowledge base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To encourage the user community as they learned the new CMS, we created weekly blogs and newsletters that featured screenshots of pages in progress,&#8221; Toothman said. &#8220;Seeing their peers’ work and out-of-the-box use of the custom blocks, users were inspired to try different things and ask more questions. Our content team held weekly office hours for managing editors to answer questions users may have, hold live demonstrations, and collect feedback to produce more user resources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By creating an environment that invites discussion, collaboration, and creativity, the content team was able to enforce content quality control standards on a massive scale while delivering a high-quality end-user experience.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toothman said he was surprised and delighted by the creative ways authors utilized certain blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Content authors figured out ways to use some of the custom Gutenberg editor blocks as design layout options and broke free of the content intention they were originally designed for,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA will be open sourcing some of its custom blocks and other pieces of the project to give back to the WordPress community as part of the roadmap. The completed project stands as a high-profile testament to the agency&#8217;s confidence in the block editor and the wider ecosystem of available tools. It also highlights WordPress as a reliable CMS with exemplary adaptability for enterprise-level projects with complex publishing requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For years, myself and many of us in the WordPress community have been mythbusting the perception from customer stakeholders in 2 areas: (a) WordPress isn’t enterprise. It’s just a blogging platform. (B) WordPress is not a secure CMS,&#8221; Toothman said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I don’t expect NASA choosing WordPress to wipe out those pre-existing perceptions, it is further evidence to support the fact that WordPress is enterprise class, and that it can meet security benchmarks.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The WordPress 6.4 release squad has decided to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1696525101347939\">punt the planned Font Library feature to 6.5</a> after core maintainers found major gaps in the Font APIs that cannot be resolved in time for the upcoming release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am currently reviewing the font APIs <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/5285\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PR</a>,&#8221; WordPress REST API co-maintainer Jonny Harris said. &#8220;I must say, I am very worried about the PR in its current state. The code simply doesn&#8217;t follow the WP core code style and doesn&#8217;t feel WordPress.&#8221; He listed a number of problems he found with the feature:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Limited developer API. We need functions like <code>wp_insert_font</code> / <code>wp_create_font</code> etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lack of filter or actions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No way to unregister font collections</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Capabilities. Creating new fonts should have capabilies and not simply map to&nbsp;<code>edit_theme_options</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Confusing API structure.&nbsp; Collection should have embedded font objects</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What happens to fonts when collections are unregistered?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If fonts are stored as post object, can I query to get all fonts from a collection?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are fonts deleted when the user is deleted?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No way to filter where a font is stored</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With time very limited in this release, it feels like actioning the above, feel like it is going too hard to achieve in this release,&#8221; Harris said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think this feature needs some more time to bake.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris said none of the REST API maintainers were involved in the early stages of the Font Library feature and they are currently &#8220;playing catch up.&#8221; The team was attempting to patch the existing design, but Harris said if a redesign of the API is planned, he would like to understand the requirements for the feature before drawing up a design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punting a flagship feature is never an easy decision, but it&#8217;s far more preferable than shipping poorly designed API&#8217;s that don&#8217;t allow users to modify and disable the feature to fit their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No is temporary but yes is forever,&#8221; WordPress core committer Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;Once the code is merged into core for release, it’s something that needs to be maintained for our extenders forever. To me, the concerns I see being raised about how people will extend the feature are enough to punt the feature.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Font Library feature was put forward late in the release cycle, landing in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-7-introduces-font-management\">Gutenberg 16.7</a> last week, with very little time for testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Features have landed after beta 1 in the past,&#8221; WordPress core committer Jonathan Desrosiers said. &#8220;But my preference is to <em>not</em> land something with this much outstanding feedback. We&#8217;d be making last minute changes and merging for public release with very little actual testing. Sure, everyone here would test as best they can. But &#8216;in the wild&#8217; WordPress testing is much different and always uncovers some strange use cases or issues that we can&#8217;t foresee.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors briefly considered delaying the release date to allow the feature more time but the consensus was for punting to 6.5, with the decision anchored in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/\">WordPress&#8217; philosophy</a> of &#8220;deadlines are not arbitrary.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Changing a scheduled release date to leave room for finalizing a feature—no matter its priority—should not be considered,&#8221; WordPress core committer Joe McGill said. &#8220;This would not be the first time that we really hoped to have a feature shipped in a release but delayed it to the next release. It seems to me that a lot of effort has gone into preparing this feature for release and the consensus is that folks need more time to get it into a state that is ready to ship in a major WordPress release, which I know is disappointing, but also speaks to the care and quality folks want to ensure we put into these releases. If it&#8217;s not ready, it&#8217;s not ready. Let&#8217;s delay it — meanwhile we are still getting valuable user feedback via the Gutenberg plugin, which is a good thing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4 release lead Josepha Haden Chomphosy made the difficult <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1696522535253159\">decision to punt the feature</a> based on contributor feedback. The removal of the Font Library does not affect other key features anticipated to land in the release. Jessica Lyschik, 6.4 default theme co-lead, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1696525030439049\">confirmed</a> the Font Library isn&#8217;t a requirement for Twenty Twenty-Four. The theme will ship with preselected fonts that get loaded from the theme assets, just like previous default themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4 Beta 3 is scheduled for October 10, 2023. This will be the last scheduled beta before RC1. </p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Mike McAlister, creator of the <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/\">free Ollie theme</a>, will be dropping the innovative onboarding features from the theme in favor of putting them into a separate plugin after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ollie-theme-faces-pushback-from-wordpress-theme-review-team\">facing pushback during the review</a> for inclusion in WordPress.org&#8217;s Themes Directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During what McAlister described as an &#8220;unnecessarily contentious&#8221; <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/149883\">review process</a> that turned unproductive and combative at certain points, and where he even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinapoena/status/1707128165808713756?s=20\">became the target of subtweets</a> from a dissenting reviewer, his team decided it was not the right time to move forward with getting the whole experience approved as originally planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister published his decision to WordPress&#8217; Theme Review Slack channel:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>We’re going to forgo putting the onboarding feature into the Ollie theme for .org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we appreciate the flexibility and open-mindedness to considering an exception for it, ultimately, it seems like it might not be the right time on the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe in the future the directory has a more defined path for experiments like this, but right now it has a potential to be a burden to reviewers and other theme developers. Not to mention a very lively (and sometimes unnecessarily contentious) discussion that distracts from the excitement and positivity around block themes and Ollie. We don’t want that! That’s a lot of energy we could be using to bring something like this to core one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, we’re figuring out what the next steps are, but it looks like we’re going to continue with Ollie on the directory (sans onboarding) while we figure out how to deliver the onboarding experience via a plugin mechanism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister&#8217;s decision comes as a surprise after he received the green light from WordPress project leader Matt Mullenweg, who encouraged Ollie&#8217;s approval as an experiment, and WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy, who <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4Y3K/p1696000530445789\">attempted to embolden McAlister towards giving the experiment a chance</a>. He also found the support of several forward-thinking members of the Themes team and much of the wider community.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The rules are based on prior data, when something novel or new comes up that resonants with users we should be willing to try something else, even the opposite of what we did before, to make a new decision. Fine to allow 1-3 themes like this through and observe.</p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1707794756468896068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would not be a good steward of our community of users if I didn’t suggest that getting the whole thing into the repo so it’s easy to find and use is the best experience for them,&#8221; Chomphosy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s some risk to adding it as-is to the repo. But the potential upside, I think, is pretty substantial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If we’re not wanting to include it because we are worried that in the future we won’t have the skills to review more of them, then that’s not exactly the theme’s problem. That’s something where we should equip our reviewers for the future as best we can.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also suggested another option where the theme moves forward without removing the onboarding while contributors work towards WordPress core creating a standard for providing better onboarding experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We get the theme in (including the onboarding) and in parallel start a feature plugin process to move the onboarding to be Core-first,&#8221; Chomphosy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That’s bold, I realize. But also, I did tell the entire hosting community at Cloudfest that if they wanted to one thing to help WP succeed, it was &#8216;better onboarding&#8217; and if they wanted to do two things, the second was &#8216;better time to launch.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting the onboarding solution into a plugin would reduce the long-term burden of maintenance and create a lower risk of failure from the theme, as Merlin WP themes onboarding wizard creator Rich Tabor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richard_tabor/status/1707775941466837232\">contends</a>, but nobody knows how long it will be before core can offer a standard solution. By then WordPress may have missed many opportunities to seamlessly onboard more block theme users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy&#8217;s suggestion of going ahead with the experiment in the theme while simultaneously working on a core solution allows theme authors to use training wheels to keep the momentum of block theme adoption going until a better, more elegant solution is available in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress leadership&#8217;s public approval was critical in this instance after the unwelcoming experience McAlister had in trying to get his free theme approved for the directory. He cited other factors regarding negative perception that influenced his decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a lot of subtle and not so subtle pressure from some higher visibility folks that feel strongly that this shouldn’t be in a theme,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;And I don’t want those relationships to degrade as a result of how this might play out.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister said he is still interested in bringing the onboarding experience to WordPress.org as a plugin, where it can be studied and experimented with, but isn&#8217;t sure how soon that can happen given the long delays in plugin reviews. The current queue has 1,247 plugins awaiting review, with wait time for an initial review at 103+ days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evolving Theme Reviews: WordPress.org Must Stop Alienating Innovators While Block Theme Adoption Is Stagnating</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WordPress leadership was quick to respond in support of experimentation, recalcitrant plugin reviewers, clinging to antiquated rules written for Classic Themes, had already driven Ollie&#8217;s innovation away with their chilly, unfriendly reception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg has historically communicated his support for experimenting with themes on multiple occasions, encouraging developers to do novel things with WordPress that may not fit within the guidelines. In 2015, he went so far as to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4Y3K/p1432861605003292\">say</a>, &#8220;I am completely okay with having something in the directory that breaks every guideline, as long as it’s interesting.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later in 2015, he <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4Y3K/p1438195918001732\">recommended the review team</a> &#8220;try to think of it as a more general opening up to interesting things that might not fit the guidelines but are novel and warrant inclusion in our directory.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, Mullenweg encouraged the team to step back and examine the submission process and the directory in a new way that would encourage creativity among theme authors with fewer guidelines and restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fundamental culture change is necessary for this team and long overdue. It should be a matter of urgency at this point, given the tone of reviewers in <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/149883\">Ollie&#8217;s trac ticket</a>. Theme reviews should bend more towards enabling innovators instead of preserving familiar processes. The response to theme authors trying new things should be friendly and helpful, especially when those new things stand to greatly benefit users. The process should not be burdensome to creators who are trying to offer their work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I mentioned earlier in the thread, another important note is that our vision for the onboarding — some of the features that people loved about it — were removed during this long review process,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;So even if it went live today, it doesn’t quite reach its maximum potential as is. And if we started adding some of those features back, I feel we’d be mired in more back and forth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This situation should be a wake up call for the review team, as WordPress&#8217; best product creators are watching to see how this plays out when considering where to distribute their best work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent spreadsheet created by Munich-based digital agency owner Hendrik Luehrsen <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11X38e9w86XcgT4tybqfjKhrL0PIbDlIsUEJwLiKtJ7Q/edit#gid=931695972\">tracks the usage of themes with the FSE tag</a>. It shows that WordPress block theme adoption is stagnating, if not in full decline. In September 2023, the total number of active installs for block themes declined for the first time since Luehrsen started tracking. The average installs by theme are also slowly and steadily declining. This could be related to the growth of the number of FSE themes available, as active installs would presumably be spread across more themes, but the number of FSE themes is growing at a glacial pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would say it’s too early to assume definitive decline,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;But we’re most certainly not growing the FSE usage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1978\" height=\"536\" data-attachment-id=\"149806\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/contentious-review-process-leads-ollie-theme-to-remove-innovative-onboarding-features-amid-stagnating-block-theme-adoption/screen-shot-2023-10-03-at-8-57-21-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"1978,536\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM-300x81.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM-500x135.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149806\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM.png 1978w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM-300x81.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM-500x135.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM-768x208.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-8.57.21-PM-1536x416.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1978px) 100vw, 1978px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Having run a number of block theme training courses, I&#8217;m not at all surprised,&#8221; Pootlepress founder Jamie Marsland <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1707820106556867027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1707835806763622467%7Ctwgr%5E36cba479119394838ab431c2ac491926810ecd2b%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D149749action%3Dedit\">said</a>. &#8220;Until Block Themes get easier to use for beginners, my guess is the numbers won&#8217;t change significantly. The dev team should try running a training course and see for themselves.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marsland recently <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/2023/09/wordpress-block-themes-versus-classic-themes/\">interviewed</a> McAlister, discussing some of the reasons for the slow uptake in block themes. Their adoption is hindered by a lack of effective marketing for their innovative features as well as the complexities involved in creating a block theme that fully supports everything a user can imagine doing with the block editor.  McAlister highlighted the necessity to create more user-friendly experiences and the importance of onboarding and better education for those using and making block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/848774684\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m not kidding when I’m saying it’s in all our interests to start making sure this becomes better soon,&#8221; Joost de Valk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1707835806763622467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1707835806763622467%7Ctwgr%5E36cba479119394838ab431c2ac491926810ecd2b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D149749action%3Dedit\">said</a> in response to the latest figures from the spreadsheet tracking FSE usage. &#8220;WP stands to lose market share if we don’t get better soon.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With block themes struggling to gain adoption, WordPress should be doing everything it can to enable any block theme that improves the user experience, especially in the absence of a core solution for onboarding. It&#8217;s important to remember that when major versions of WordPress are released, the only people who can take advantage of the latest and greatest editor features are those whose sites are using a block theme. After three years, WordPress.org block theme installs only account for 1.7 million sites out of an estimated <a href=\"https://colorlib.com/wp/wordpress-statistics/\">810 million</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As someone who has been trying to get block themes to be adopted by a wider audience from early, I feel onboarding/switching to block themes is a big hurdle for users still,&#8221; ElmaStudio co-creator Ellen Baer <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4Y3K/p1696321112372359?thread_ts=1696000530.445789&amp;cid=C02RP4Y3K\">said</a> in the conversation in the Theme Review Slack channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I personally would love to see a core solution, a standarized way that all block theme users can get familiar with. I feel unfortunately while building the site editor experience this point has been missing and block theme authors are seeing the user struggling to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I feel a bit sad that a positive innovation that helps block themes and the site editor to gain more momentum (which is what we really need) is dragged into a discussion that seemed at least from the outside not to be a productive or positive one at times.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister&#8217;s attempt to improve WordPress.org theme users&#8217; onboarding experience was unsuccessful but he inadvertently highlighted some areas where the culture and process around theme reviews has stagnated and become counterproductive. This failure shed light on the need for a more dynamic, user-centric approach, as well as a reassessment of the current guidelines by which the team appears to be bizarrely and inextricably bound despite years of encouragement to experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a deep, deep desire for evolution of the theme directory,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;I think we’ve always known this, but after wading through weeks of commentary, it’s clear to me that we’ve neglected it far too long. The theme pages should be at least as good as the plugin pages, the theme demos aren’t selling the value of themes, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The hardline approach and the echos of longstanding esoteric debates need relaxing. Users largely don’t care about the theme vs plugin debate, they want to design and publish faster. That’s not to say we throw these things out, but we have to ask if they’re serving WordPress users in the ways we think they are.&#8221;</p>\n",

The program does not include flagship events such as WordCamps Europe, Asia, and US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fees have gone up since 2023 for all three sponsorship packages: Gold, Silver, and Bronze, which offer varying degrees of visibility at in-person WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:14px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Gold</td><td>Silver</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>$130,000</td><td>$95,000</td><td>$80,000</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>$145,000</td><td>$115,000</td><td>$90,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2021 and 2022 programs <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-global-sponsorship-program-will-not-include-wordcamps-for-2022\">did not include funding for WordCamps</a>, due to the unpredictability of hosting in-person events when the pandemic made conditions unfavorable in many places across the world. At that time many WordCamp and meetup organizers opted to continue with virtual events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, WordPress events are ramping back up again. Automattic-sponsored community contributor Isotta Peira said the number of in-person events has increased by 60% compared to 2022, and they expect Next Gen events will keep the program growing into 2024. So far 15 pilot events have been confirmed for the new Next Gen format, with 11 of them happening in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a result of the Meetup Reactivation project that started in July 2022 and ended in June 2023, 270 dormant Meetups started hosting events again,&#8221; Peira said. &#8220;Today, we have 729 WordPress Chapter Meetups in 107 countries and over 500,000 members globally. In the first 7 months of 2023, the WordPress Community has held 27 WordCamps, and another 29 are scheduled before year-end.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal highlighted a few stats demonstrating the strong resurgence of community events: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>36 local WordCamps held in 2023 to date, with 25 more scheduled before year end</li>\n\n\n\n<li>173% increase in WordCamps since last year: 60 WordCamps anticipated to be held in 2023, compared to 22 in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>729 meetup groups across 107 countries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>507,796 meetup group members, program-wide</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2,998 meetup events scheduled in 2023 to date, and over 340 more scheduled through the end of the year</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The uptick in events is the direct result of the Community team&#8217;s efforts in 2023 to reactivate dormant meetup groups, bring back in-person WordCamps, and evolve the WordCamp program to make room for new event types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies that are interested to support WordPress&#8217; burgeoning events program can get on board for 2024 by emailing <a href=\"mailto:support@wordcamp.org\">support@wordcamp.org</a> before November 30, 2023. </p>\n",

This will be the last plugin release that will be rolled into the next version of WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Font management with the new font library is now available for testing in the plugin. These features standardize a way to add font collections to WordPress&#8217; new font library, so plugin authors can register lists of fonts and users can install the ones they want. It also enables font foundries to create their own WordPress plugins to provide access to their fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54169\">Font Library</a> manages fonts independently of a site&#8217;s active theme, allowing users to install, remove, and activate fonts from various sources in WordPress. This works in a similar way to the Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After updating to Gutenberg 16.7, users can navigate to Styles > Typography to manage fonts. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1752\" height=\"1086\" data-attachment-id=\"149693\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-7-introduces-font-management/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at-5-24-43-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"1752,1086\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-300x186.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-500x310.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149693\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM.png 1752w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-300x186.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-500x310.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-768x476.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-1536x952.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-29-at-5.24.43-PM-710x439.png 710w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1752px) 100vw, 1752px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, users can launch the Font Library, which loads in a popup screen, and browse all of the installed fonts.

      "content": "\n<p>Mike McAlister, creator of the <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/\">free Ollie theme</a>, has been working towards getting his theme approved for hosting on WordPress.org. Ollie <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ollie-block-theme-now-in-public-beta\">went into public beta</a> in April 2023 and gained momentum over the next few months when McAlister <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ollie-theme-previews-new-onboarding-wizard-in-development\">previewed the theme&#8217;s new onboarding wizard</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress users have been slow to adopt the block editor and block themes by extension. In 2022, only <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/2022-Annual-Survey-Final.pdf\">54% of respondents to WordPress&#8217; annual survey have used the block editor</a>, four years after it was introduced. Block themes have trickled into the official directory, far behind the lofty goals set for their expansion. The sluggish movement towards block-based sites has led some to speculate on <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/will-there-ever-be-a-market-for-commercial-block-themes/\">whether there will ever be a market for commercial block themes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie was designed to make onboarding to a block theme easier and the Site Editor more approachable, so that users don&#8217;t have to start from a blank canvas. The theme&#8217;s <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/ollie-demo/\">demo</a> boasts &#8220;a 40-hr head start&#8221; on setting up a new WordPress website, thanks in part to dozens of patterns for fast page building. Ollie&#8217;s built-in onboarding experience aims to drastically reduce the amount of time users spend getting started.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:17px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-attachment-id=\"149635\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/ollie-theme-faces-pushback-from-wordpress-theme-review-team/screenshot-8\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot.png\" data-orig-size=\"1200,900\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"screenshot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-300x225.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-500x375.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149635\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot.png 1200w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-300x225.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-500x375.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving significant pushback from the Theme Review team during Ollie&#8217;s three weeks in the queue, McAlister has put up a poll requesting feedback on how he should proceed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After a very rocky (and downright combative) theme review process at <a href=\"https://t.co/SPJ2MEtIlL\">https://t.co/SPJ2MEtIlL</a>, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the right place for our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuildWithOllie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BuildWithOllie</a> project. <br><br>I&#39;m torn and would love your input. More context below and a poll at the end.</p>&mdash; Mike McAlister 🧑‍🚀 (@mikemcalister) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1707446456037134471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although provisionally approved by veteran theme reviewer Justin Tadlock, who said the onboarding functionality should be allowed until WordPress core offers a standard solution, Ollie was met with heavy criticism from other members of the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The setup wizard is plugin territory,&#8221; UXL Themes founder and theme reviewer Andrew Starr said. &#8220;Why not make this as a plugin that would work with any block theme? A plugin could be inspiration or a nudge to improve the core experience.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister responded to this question in the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/149883\">Trac ticket for the review</a> and in posts on X. He maintains that a plugin is a &#8220;far worse experience for the end user&#8221; and for his team as the maintainers of the product. Also, since the plugin review queue has 1,249 plugins awaiting review with developers waiting an average of 98 days for an initial review, a plugin for Ollie&#8217;s onboarding experience would likely not be live until next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a compromise and show of good faith, I&#8217;ve chopped down the onboarding wizard to a fraction of what it was,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No dice. Still, it continues to be a highly contentious issue that is causing folks to publicly question my intentions and integrity. Disheartening to say the least.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored contributor Justin Tadlock, who helped author the guidelines in question many years ago and who has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-is-cracking-down-on-violations-of-the-presentation-vs-functionality-guideline\">historically</a> been widely esteemed for his impeccable judgment in regards to the <a href=\"https://justintadlock.com/archives/2015/05/28/the-theme-review-teams-content-creation-discussion\">grey areas of content creation</a> in themes and the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-theme-developers-are-moving-functionality-into-plugins\">necessity of preserving data portability</a>, weighed in on the ticket after performing the initial review:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>As someone who co-wrote the original guideline for settings to use the customizer, I can say with 100% certainty that we never meant that to be a hard line drawn in the sand. The team reps can and have always had the capability to mark a theme as a &#8220;special case&#8221; (there&#8217;s even a tag for this in the backend, or there was when I was a rep). And there are themes where we felt like the functionality was unique enough to give it a bit of wiggle room. That was a position that we took when we wrote the &#8220;settings must be in the customizer&#8221; guideline. While I&#8217;m no longer one of the team reps, I feel like this settings page feature is unique enough to mark as a &#8220;special case.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With block themes, some things must be reevaluated because the customizer is not available by default and is not an expected part of the block theme experience. In fact, this guideline is very specific to classic themes. Nothing has been written yet for block themes. Whether that&#8217;s a good thing, I don&#8217;t know. This could be a good moment for experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I disagree that the settings page should be packaged as a companion plugin. That defeats the purpose of its inclusion in the theme, and it would create an additional hurdle for the users who would benefit the most from this feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast-sponsored contributor Carolina Nymark <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/149883#comment:21\">contends</a> that allowing this onboarding experience will set a precedent that erodes the standard the team is trying to uphold for the ecosystem of themes hosted on WordPress.org and gives Ollie an unfair commercial advantage:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;That settings pages are not allowed is in many ways unrelated to the customizer. And if we really want to angle it that way, it would be way easier to re-enable the customizer link in the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about having a&nbsp;<strong>standard</strong>&nbsp;that is easy for&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;theme authors to use and easy to review.<br>It is about not opening up the reviews to another situation with incredibly difficult and time consuming reviews of code that the theme developers themselves don&#8217;t understand because they copy-pasted it and managed to cause all sorts of errors and security issues.<br><strong>Where</strong>&nbsp;that feature &#8220;lives&#8221;, in the customizer or on another page, is not the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like everyone to also consider that the Site Editor is not at all far away from solving the problem with the initial template selection. It does not solve all onboarding steps, like getting to the Site Editor, but it is improving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare it with the use of TGMPA. There is a problem that needs solving and a solution has been agreed upon where the theme author and reviewers only need to adjust a few variables and text strings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If something similar could be reached here I would support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not about a special case, because it is an unfair commercial advantage over other theme developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie is a beautifully-designed multipurpose theme of the highest caliber, the likes of which WordPress.org doesn&#8217;t see very often. If expanding block theme adoption is an important goal, these are the kinds of experiences you want people building for WordPress users. It may be time to redefine theme guidelines based on the possibilities that the block editor enables, instead of saddling block themes with antiquated constraints <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinapoena/status/1707128165808713756?s=20\">for the sake of maintaining a more expedient review process</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just because there are problems with onboarding it doesn&#8217;t mean that a theme, any theme, is the right tool just because one can put code in it,&#8221; Nymark said. &#8220;Plugins extend features, themes display content.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the amount of pushback from the Theme Review team, McAlister is now torn about removing everything &#8220;extra&#8221; to get Ollie in the directory for better distribution, or to keep the innovations in place and forego the directory in favor of independent distribution. So far, the results of his poll are overwhelmingly in favor of McAlister distributing the theme himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m passionate about innovation and getting the most out of all the possibilities that modern WordPress affords us,&#8221; McAlister told the Tavern. &#8220;We were tasked to &#8216;Learn JavaScript Deeply&#8217; not to remain where we’ve been for so long, but to push the boundaries and scope out the future of WordPress and what’s possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So we designed and developed Ollie’s educational dashboard and onboarding wizard to help users get over some of the hurdles they’ve been plagued with for so long when setting up a new site or switching to a new theme. We even designed it in a very core-inspired way to match the site editor to create a very cohesive experience. The feedback has been inspiring!&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1707446456037134471\">posting</a> about his experience with the Theme Review team, which McAlister characterized as &#8220;rocky (and downright combative),&#8221; the community following his work on Ollie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1706389121717969202\">over the past year</a> has rallied around him with advice and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am torn about this,&#8221; Joost de Valk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1707483200082100561\">commented</a> on McAlister&#8217;s poll on X. &#8220;I feel WordPress needs these onboarding experiences. Very very much. Should it be in themes? Not sure. Should the theme repository block this stuff? I don’t think so… we should be open to experimenting with this a bit more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister said that even as the theme&#8217;s creator, he is torn about the decision as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I built this as a good faith attempt to help people onboard into block themes and hopefully even help drive adoption,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My intentions are pure and steeped in 15 years of doing it &#8216;the WP way.&#8217; It’s an attempt to move the needle, worth a shot anyway.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I always felt that onboarding like this should be part of Core,&#8221; Yoast-sponsored contributor Ari Stathopoulos <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aristath/status/1707483762336919738\">commented</a>. &#8220;The current experience for a newcomer to WP is not a good one. We have to start somewhere… if it’s in themes, then so be it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Theme Review team has a critical choice here, whether to stifle innovation and throw the book at one of the most highly anticipated block themes, or identify this as a special case where the author has the users&#8217; best interests at heart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many participants in the discussion on X encouraged McAlister to distribute his work independently, citing examples of other WordPress products that have found success in doing so. This would be an unfortunate loss for WordPress.org where the project is essentially shooting itself in the foot by clinging to outmoded guidelines in order to deny high quality block themes that are innovating to create a better user experience. In pursuit of a more robust offering of block themes, the last thing WordPress needs to do is chase away its trailblazers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Generally speaking, given the amount of pure sh*t available in the .org repo, the fact that they wont welcome you with open arms just stinks.<br><br>Self distribute.<br><br>You&#39;ve got something incredible here.</p>&mdash; Anthony (@ant_thedesigner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ant_thedesigner/status/1707490391316922793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since this morning, there has been an overwhelming amount of feedback telling me to avoid the WordPress.org directory,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;I’m kind of bummed by this because I think it says something about the directory that a lot of folks think but few want to say out loud. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I want the directory to succeed and be an inspiring and resourceful jump-off point for new WordPress users! It’s the front page of our open source project, of our community. It should be a showcase of the finest our community has to offer. But today, I’m disheartened and not sure if it’s the place where I want to put some of my best work to date.&#8221;</p>\n",

The 2022 survey introduced the Likert scale, a rating scale that quantitatively assesses opinions, attitudes, or behaviors. The total number of questions were reduced, with socio-economic questions mostly removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is still evolving the survey format to get a better understanding of the community&#8217;s sentiments and values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This year, like last year, the survey has undergone some improvements to the flow and question set,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored contributor Dan Soschin said. &#8220;A new platform is also being piloted, offering an updated interface, enhanced multi-lingual support, expanded analysis and visualization tools for the results, and more. The new platform also has built-in accessibility and privacy controls, ensuring the survey meets the diverse needs of the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 survey takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. It collects information on some basic demographics, various community involvements, preferred WordPress editor, how and why you are using WordPress, and more. Several questions allow the community to weigh in on the most frustrating aspects of WordPress, areas that need more attention, and whether or not the current <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">WordPress roadmap</a> reflects respondents&#8217; needs and desires for the future of the project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to English, the survey is available in nine widely-used languages, which participants can select from a drop-down menu at the top of the page. All the data collected in the survey will be anonymized and WordPress does not associate IP addresses or email addresses with the results.</p>\n",

The backup codes come with a note of caution from Automattic- sponsored Meta contributor Steve Dufresne, who has been working on the 2FA project:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Regardless of whether you are using security keys or a Time-Based One-Time password, <strong>make sure you generate and print backup codes</strong>. If you lose your primary key/device and don’t have a backup code, you will lose access to your account forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dufresne encouraged WordPress.org users who haven&#8217;t set up 2FA to go ahead and do so. Any bugs can be reported to the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wporg-two-factor\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n",

      "slug": "matthaus-klute-acquires-social-link-pages-plugin",
      "content": "\n<p>WordPress developer <a href=\"https://gelform.com/\">Corey Maass</a> has sold his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-link-pages/\">Social Link Pages</a> plugin to Matthaus Klute, an independent WordPress consultant and developer with Alpha Particle. It&#8217;s another story of small plugins changing hands, where developers get the opportunity to test ideas and business models. Even the most modest creations have value in a thriving marketplace where business owners are willing to invest in these types of assets to expand their own offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Maass created Social Link Pages after taking a course on how to market himself as a musician and DJ. The course required him to sign up for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://linktr.ee/\" target=\"_blank\">Linktr.ee</a>, a popular &#8220;link in bio&#8221; landing page service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In typical developer fashion, instead of paying $8 a month, I thought &#8216;I should build this,'&#8221; Maass said. &#8220;So I spent hundreds of hours building Social Link Pages for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Maass built the free version with most of the basic bells and whistles found in other link-in-bio page builders. After getting some pushback from the Plugin Review team, who Maass said were &#8220;skeptical about why we needed a &#8216;mini WordPress inside WordPress,&#8217; the Social Link Pages plugin was approved for the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next year he added features that he needed while figuring out the right extras for a Pro version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Along the way, a user contacted me, asking if the plug-in could be white-labeled and used to build her own SaaS,&#8221; Maass said. &#8220;Shortly thereafter I released the Pro and Community (i.e. SaaS) versions of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Then I took a day job and stopped working on it for about a year and a half. I took the commercial versions offline. I barely looked at the plugin because there were almost no support requests.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Maass&#8217; day job ended 18 months later, he went back to the plugin and was pleasantly surprised to find it had 1,000 active installs. This encouraged him to make some major updates and add new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first marketing effort he made was to put Social Link Pages on AppSumo. At that time they were just opening up their marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the marketplace, you don&#8217;t benefit from AppSumo&#8217;s larger email campaigns, but I think Social Link Pages got a lot of eyes from people looking for good lifetime deals,&#8221; Maass said. &#8220;I sold about 80-lifetime licenses and was surprised to find that only two or three were ever actually claimed. I&#8217;ve since heard of other plugin developers who have had the same experience. Apparently, a lot of people collect lifetime deals, but never actually use them. So in the end it was free money.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next few years, Maass continued to add features but his interest was waning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The plugin did what I needed on my own sites, so I was not inspired to keep adding features just because I could,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I also saw a lot of new link-in-bio apps come online, though none were specific to WordPress. And I wanted to move on to new ideas.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2023, while considering all of his projects, Maass said he &#8220;could not find the willpower to market Social Link Pages as it should be.&#8221; He knew he was no longer the best owner for the plugin, so he listed it on a couple of sites dedicated to selling small software products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social Links Plugin Sells for $3K</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d always heard the correct pricing for a software product is 12-18 months of revenue,&#8221; Maass said. &#8220;Social Link Pages was only making about $125 per month at the time, but I was selling a complete business, already set up with e-commerce, multiple products, email automation, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I listed it at $5000. I heard from a dozen or so potential buyers, all of whom asked for charts and spreadsheets I did not have. I&#8217;m a developer and guilty of ignoring a lot of the standard sales and &#8216;biz dev&#8217; practices. As I was asking too much based on what was &#8216;on paper,&#8217; I did not find a buyer. I unlisted Social Link Pages, figuring I&#8217;d try again in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maass tried again in the summer, listing the plugin in Post Status and a couple of other solopreneur-focused communities. He also dropped the price to $3,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Immediately I heard from a number of interested buyers who saw the value in what I was selling,&#8221; Maass said.&#8221; I probably could&#8217;ve brought the price back up to $5000 again, but I wanted to see the plugin go to a new, better owner.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/alpha-particle-and-flowspoke-acquire-kanban-for-wordpress-for-15k\">Maass sold his Kanban for WordPress plugin to Keanan Koppenhaver</a> at Alpha Particle. After discussing with Matthaus Klute, a developer who works with Koppenhaver, Maass knew he had found the right buyer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a thoughtful developer with WordPress experience interested in building a product business,&#8221; Maass said. &#8220;We met up in person at WordCamp US in DC in August 2023, and spent a few hours moving all accounts to his name and getting him set up. It was a fun experience to do in person.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klute said Maass came to him highly recommended from others who had purchased plugins from him in the past. After he spoke with his lawyer, they proceeded to do an in-person asset transfer at WordCamp US (WCUS).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I wasn’t actively shopping for a plugin, however I’ve always had a passing interest in asset and/or small businesses acquisitions,&#8221; Klute said. &#8220;Corey&#8217;s plugin caught my attention for several reasons. It fit well within my budget, boasted an active user base, and generated consistent recurring revenue.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With my 9 -5 spent coding, the prospect of having an existing solution that I could focus on marketing rather than building was enticing. Lastly, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the plugin ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klute said Maass&#8217;s experience played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth transfer. He had all the plugin&#8217;s accounts and services separated from his other entities, making it easily transferable. While at WCUS, they conducted a few Zoom sessions to explore the plugin&#8217;s codebase in-depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Despite the focus on marketing, I do have a few ideas for the plugin roadmap,&#8221; Klute said. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking at the possibility of a digital business card functionality similar to Blinq and also exploring ways to enhance the plugin’s compatibility with WooCommerce for my dynamic shop functionality for e-commerce businesses.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "slug": "block-visibility-3-1-0-adds-woocommerce-and-easy-digital-downloads-controls",
      "content": "\n<p>When WordPress contributor and developer Nick Diego released version 3.0 of his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility/\">Block Visibility</a> plugin earlier this year in March, he <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-visibility-3-0-0-makes-pro-version-free-adds-browser-and-device-control-visibility-presets-and-more\">made all the Pro features available in the free version</a>, with the exception of a few that would take more time. The plugin, which is used on more than 10,000 WordPress sites, allows users to conditionally display blocks based on specific user roles, logged in/out, specific users, screen sizes, query strings, ACF fields, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/block-visibility-3-1-0-introducing-woocommerce-and-edd-controls/\">3.1.0 update</a> Block Visibility has added the missing WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) controls. These features were originally planned to be merged into the free version in April but required more development to improve how they work on sites with large product/download catalogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce controls include 18 conditional visibility rules with full support for products with variable pricing. It allows users to show or hide blocks based on products, cart contents, customer purchase history, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is one notable change to the product-based rules,&#8221; Diego said. &#8220;Previously, you had to select which product you wanted to target with the visibility conditions. While this is still possible, Block Visibility can now detect the current product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This functionality is extremely useful on product pages, single product templates, and product grids (Query blocks).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"425\" data-attachment-id=\"149400\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/block-visibility-3-1-0-adds-woocommerce-and-easy-digital-downloads-controls/detect-current-product\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/detect-current-product.gif\" data-orig-size=\"500,425\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"detect-current-product\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/detect-current-product-300x255.gif\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/detect-current-product.gif\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/detect-current-product.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149400\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The EDD controls allow users to show or hide blocks based on downloads, cart contents, customer purchase history, and more. Since EDD doesn&#8217;t have as many block-powered layouts as WooCommerce, Diego did not include the &#8220;Detect current product&#8221; feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The EDD visibility control currently has no product-based rules,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If greater block support is added to EDD in the future, such as an EDD Products block that supports inner blocks, expect more functionality.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Visibility 3.1.0 also adds a new Command Palette command to &#8220;Manage Visibility Presets,&#8221; which requires WordPress 6.3+.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1372\" height=\"985\" data-attachment-id=\"149403\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/block-visibility-3-1-0-adds-woocommerce-and-easy-digital-downloads-controls/command-palette-manage-visibility-presets\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/command-palette-manage-visibility-presets.gif\" data-orig-size=\"1372,985\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"command-palette-manage-visibility-presets\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/command-palette-manage-visibility-presets-300x215.gif\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/command-palette-manage-visibility-presets-500x359.gif\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/command-palette-manage-visibility-presets.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149403\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">image credit: Block Visibility repository &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/ndiego/block-visibility/pull/84\">PR #84</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego said he doesn&#8217;t plan on adding any new integrations to the plugin but will continue improving existing controls. Now that all the features from the Pro version have been merged into the free plugin, users who have the Pro version installed can deactivate it after upgrading to version 3.1.0.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Plugin Review Team continues to dig out from under a massive backlog that has grown to 1,260 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/\">plugins awaiting review</a>.  Developers submitting new plugins can expect to wait at least 91 days, according to the notice on the queue today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>Currently there are 1,241 plugins awaiting review</em>,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Plugin Review team member Alvaro Gómez said earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are painstakingly aware of this. We check that number every day and realize how this delay is affecting plugin authors.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the backlog seems to be getting worse, Gómez published an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2023/09/19/update-turning-the-tide/\">update</a> outlining new systems the team is putting in place to get the situation under control. He likened it to patching a hole in a boat, as opposed to simply prioritizing bailing out the water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;During the last six months, the Plugin review team has worked on documenting its processes, training new members, and improving its tools,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now, thanks to your patience and support, the tide is about to turn.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has now onboarded two rounds of new members, with three more reviewers added recently, and has a system in place to make this easier in the future. After receiving more than 40 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/apply/\">applications</a> to join the team, the form will be closing at the end of September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also sent plugin authors still waiting in the queue an email asking them to self-check their plugins to meet basic security standards, as another effort to mitigate the growing backlog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We find ourselves correcting the same three or four errors on +95% of plugins and this is not a good use of our time,&#8221; Gómez said. &#8220;Once authors confirm that their plugins meet these basic requirements, we will proceed with the review.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/\">Plugin Check</a> has just been published to WordPress.org for plugin authors to self-review for common errors, which will eventually be integrated into the plugin submission process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once the PCP is merged with <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/plugin-check\">this other plugin that the Performance team has been working on</a>, it will provide <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/07/05/proposal-for-a-wordpress-plugin-checker/\">checks for a lot of other things</a>,&#8221; Gómez  said. &#8220;When this is completed, we will be in a better spot to take in feedback and make improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the short term, we are going to ask authors to test their plugins using the PCP before submitting them, but our goal is to integrate the plugin as <strong>part of the submission process</strong> and run automated checks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far plugin authors have reported a few bugs and issues with the plugin not recognizing files or giving unintelligible errors. These issues can be reported on the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/plugin-check/\">GitHub repo</a>, which is temporarily hosted on the 10up GitHub account but will be moving to WordPress.org in the near future.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://2023.wpaccessibility.day/\">WP Accessibility Day</a> (WPAD), an independent 24-hour virtual conference, has published its <a href=\"https://2023.wpaccessibility.day/schedule/\">schedule</a> for the upcoming event on September 27, 2023. Co-lead organizer Amber Hinds reports that more than 1,248 people have registered for the event so far with attendees across 30 different countries. Approximately 50% of attendees are from the U.S. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPAD has attracted an influx of new voices this year. All speakers, excluding sponsored sessions, are first-time speakers at the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were nervous initially about speaker applicants, but we actually received a lot more speaker applications than last year and also more applications that were higher quality than in previous years,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;It was hard to decide!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keynote address will feature a conversation between Jennison Asuncion, co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), and Joe Dolson, an accessibility consultant and co-founder of WordPress Accessibility Day. Attendees will learn how to perform usability and accessibility tests on their websites, how to build an accessible WordPress pages and posts using the block editor, simple ways to make email more accessible, how to understand color and contrast requirements in WCAG 2, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the stats for speakers (of people who opted to give the info), WPAD&#8217;s organizers have succeeded at recruiting a diverse lineup for the event:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>10 countries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>67% female, 30% male, 3% Nonbinary</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14% LGBTQ</li>\n\n\n\n<li>41% non-white identifying</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 first time speakers who have never spoken at any event.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>11 of the 27 speakers identify as having a disability. (41%) &#8211; There are speakers who identify as blind/low vision, deaf or hard of hearing, have limited mobility, and learning disabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These were the hardest decisions we&#8217;ve had to make yet in selecting the WordPress Accessibility Day speakers,&#8221; Speaker Team lead Joe Dolson said. &#8220;There were so many truly excellent ideas proposed. As a result, our speakers include people who work across many different aspects of the web &#8211; inside and outside the WordPress community. I feel like we&#8217;ve ended up with an excellent cross section of topics, so we have something to offer for developers, policy makers, content creators, or community organizers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPAD <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-accessibility-day-secures-nonprofit-status-for-annual-event-calls-for-speakers-and-sponsors\">secured non-profit status</a> earlier this year through a fiscal sponsorship partnership with <a href=\"https://knowbility.org/\">Knowbility</a>, an Austin-based digital accessibility advocate and services provider. One of the reasons the organizers wanted to manage it independently of the WordPress Foundation was to reserve the option to do things like pay speakers for their time and expertise. Speaker pay is one expenditure for the event, which is supported by corporate and community sponsors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinds said it was easier to attract sponsors this year and that the sponsors team received positive responses fairly quickly. They also added a microsponsorship option earlier this year (previously it was only on the registration form) and were able to recruit more businesses as microsponsors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team&#8217;s goal this year was to get enough sponsorships to cover the cost of the event itself, make a donation to Knowbility (part of the event&#8217;s fiscal sponsorship agreement with them), and have enough leftover to cover year-round expenses, such as Google workspace, Buffer, domain registration, and hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinds said the organization met its sponsorship goals at most tiers, due to the hard work of the Sponsors team leads Bet Hannon and Joe Hall, along with the generosity of the community in supporting the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to have doubled the number of sponsors this year over last year,&#8221; Hannon said. &#8220;I think this reflects the increasing awareness about accessibility as an issue to be addressed, as well as the wider WordPress community coming together to sponsor an event providing high quality accessibility education.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New in 2023: WPAD to Broadcast via Zoom</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to a whole new crop of speakers this year, WPAD is offering t-shirts for the first time as a thank you gift to attendees who want to make a donation when they register. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We had a lot of people ask us last year how they could get a t-shirt, but they were only available to organizers, speakers, and volunteers,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;This year they’re available during registration so anyone can get one.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year the event was broadcast via an embedded YouTube video on the WPAD website with third-party embeds for chat/Q&amp;A and the live transcript. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We got feedback from attendees that this did not work well because they didn’t have control of the layout of the video,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;It was particularly limiting for attendees who rely on the sign language interpreters; they needed the interpreter video to be larger. Other people said that they found the interpretation to be distracting or they needed the slides to be bigger so they would be easier to read.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 event will be live streamed using Zoom, which recently introduced a sign language interpretation view that allows hosts to assign interpreters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Attendees can choose to view the sign language interpretation in a separate window,&#8221; Hinds said.  &#8220;With this new feature available, we decided to change to Zoom webinars. We have one long 24-hour webinar that people can jump in and out of as they see fit, and each attendee can set a view for speakers, slides, signers, and captions that works best for them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2023.wpaccessibility.day/attendee-registration/\">Registration</a> for the event is free and it&#8217;s still open. Attendees have the opportunity to receive virtual swag and win prizes from the sponsors. Organizers have also gotten the conference pre-approved for continuing education credits for the International Association of Accessibility Professionals <a href=\"https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification\">Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional\">Certified Professional in Core Competencies (CPACC)</a> certifications.</p>\n",

The list spans a wide range of ideas, such as college campus based groups, sponsor networking days, show and tell night, job fairs, events for agencies, WordPress retreats, and many more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who is interested to host one of these new event types is invited to <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/next-generation-of-wordpress-events\">fill out a form</a> that the Community team has created to capture ideas for future events &#8211; either before the end of 2023, or during the first half of 2024. Organizers will be asked to identify a category for their proposed event from among the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WP expertise level (beginners, intermediate, advanced)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Focused activity (training, recruiting, networking, contributing, conferencing, etc)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Job status (students, fresh graduates, job seekers, freelancers, business owners, etc)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identity-based (women, castes, BIPOC, Latinx, LGBTQI+, tribes, age, etc)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Content topic focused (designers, block development, SEO, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the form is presented as a survey, it&#8217;s more of an interest form, which is why it collects the respondent&#8217;s contact information. Respondents who indicate they are willing to have a discussion about their ideas may be contacted by the Community team.</p>\n",

During that discussion, many developers were surprised to learn that their plugins created for WordPress.org were also listed on WordPress.com as only available with a paid subscription. Patchstack responded by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/developers-claim-damaged-trust-following-public-confrontations-with-wordpress-leadership\">updating its readme file</a> to ensure that WordPress.com users and visitors are made aware that the plugin is available for free in the official WordPress plugin repository.

The omission of a link back to WordPress.org may be intentional, as it would take users off of the .com site, which does not facilitate customers upgrading to paid plans in order to use plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some developers had also asked Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg to noindex those pages, but he said that WordPress.com users should also be able to search Google for the listings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think it should show up for .com users who are Googling, and Google appears smart enough prioritize correctly.

Mullenweg said there are currently no reports for this but that the data could be interesting. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are no reports currently for plugin installs by web host.

If you have ever sat up all night with a feverish infant, searching for answers on a mommy messaging board, hunted down solutions for obscure bugs, or wasted an entire afternoon on a subreddit, then you know that forums are not dead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the early days of BBSes (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\">Wikipedia link</a> for you young whippersnappers), which housed prototypical forums before the advent of the World Wide Web, modern forums have evolved and established themselves as a stalwart, timeless medium for asynchronous communication, fostering communities, and sharing knowledge among individuals with diverse interests and needs.<br><br>Today we will begin exploring how forums can help expand conversations that originate on the Tavern, especially within the comments of a post. Our new forums are powered by bbPress, which enables readers to create discussions by visiting the comment section of an article and clicking on “Create forum topic from comment” based on comments that you find particularly insightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the forum called “<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/forums/forum/discussions\">Discussion</a>” you will find topics that have been created based on article comments. This offers readers a way to engage further with comments that spark larger discussions, long after the article has been published and comments have closed. This feature is available alongside traditional bbPress forums where logged-in users can create topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a forum topic already exists for a comment, a link labeled “Continue Discussion in Forum” will appear on that topic, leading to the ongoing forum discussion. This prevents people from creating multiple forum topics from a single comment. These topics will include a link back to the original comment at the top of the thread. It is also still possible to add regular (non-forum) replies to comments as usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readers must be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/register\">registered and logged in</a> order to post on the forums. At this time, topics and replies will continue to be moderated before they are published. We have tried wild west commenting style in the past and it doesn&#8217;t work well for raising the level of discourse and engagement that we hope to have in our forums. Come <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/register\">join us</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/forums/forum/introductions\">introduce yourself</a>, and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/forums\">start some new topics</a>.</p>\n",

Its annual awards recognize outstanding contributions to the Open Education community and its network of resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse is one of 16 winners selected from more than 170 applicants. The award reviewers suggested Openverse &#8220;should be the primary recommended search for OER development,&#8221; due to its clear licensing and easy, one-click attribution, among other features:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>That easy attribution feature (one-click copy for a full formed Creative Commons attribution) might be reason enough for an award, but the features to filter searches by source collections and other parameters (image orientation, specific license) provides seekers of open content important affordances to find clearly licensed media they can reuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse should be the primary recommended search for OER development, as the licensing is explicitly clear, not subject to third party owners writing their own license), being of great value for projects that mix content from multiple sources. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse has made significant progress since coming under the WordPress project&#8217;s umbrella. In the past year, the team has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/394\">added usage analytics</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/415\">made major improvements to its user interface</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/386\">moved Openverse out of an iFrame</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/377\">added filtering and blurring of sensitive results</a> (nearing completion), among many other technical improvements. The team is requesting feedback as they begin planning the 2024 roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This project thrives on collaboration, and as we begin plotting our course for 2024, we want to hear from <em>you</em>,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Openverse data engineer Madison Swain-Bowden said. &#8220;Have an idea that could improve Openverse? Noticed a feature gap we haven’t addressed? Have suggestions to improve existing features? We are eager to hear all about it!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who wants to contribute a proposal regarding Openverse&#8217;s future can publish a comment to the team&#8217;s blog <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/openverse/2023/09/15/openverse-2024-planning-we-want-your-ideas/\">post requesting feedback</a>.

Although both are used in academic and scholarly writing to provide references and additional information about sources used in a document, there are a few key differences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citations credit the original source of the information with all the source details in the bibliography at the end of the document. Footnotes are  more flexible in that they can include additional context or comments at the bottom of the document, to keep the text from becoming too cluttered with explanatory notes. They may also be used to source citations with the author, title, and publication details, but do not always follow the bibliography format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Citations plugin also includes a pattern that will insert some Lorem Ipsum paragraphs with citations and a sample bibliography with sources at the bottom. This gives users an idea of how the plugin can be used to structure a document for citing sources, if they are just getting started. Users can search for &#8220;Citations Demo&#8221; in the pattern search bar to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/citations/\">Download the plugin</a> for free from WordPress.org, or give it a <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=citations\">test drive using WordPress Playground</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The WordPress community is ending two days of heated discussions that rapidly descended into a mire of unbridled emotional confrontations across multiple social channels, following a tweet from John Blackbourn that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/developers-raise-concerns-about-wordpress-com-plugin-listings-outranking-wordpress-org-on-google\">raised concerns about WordPress.com plugin listings outranking WordPress.org on Google Search</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers expressed concerns about the SEO impact of the practice of cloning WordPress.org&#8217;s plugin directory for use on WordPress.com, with no backlinks to the original plugin. Another concern is that it perpetuates the longstanding confusion between WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the SEO concern is real, and by that I mean that besides John&#8217;s screenshot, which I think is related to the .org en-gb subdomain decision/bug,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg told the Tavern when asked whether WordPress.com is considering not indexing these pages that duplicate content from WordPress.org. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For general searches I&#8217;m seeing .com 5 pages down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just looking at traffic to those pages, they don&#8217;t seem to be getting much if any from search engines! So I&#8217;m not really concerned about SEO of those pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The vast majority of the traffic to those is to logged in users. When they click &#8216;manage&#8217; they can easily install it across multiple sites or see where it&#8217;s already installed, which actually works across .com and Jetpack sites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He offered a similar explanation to Freemius founder Vova Feldman on X, who claimed that WordPress.com has an SEO advantage over independent plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think you&#39;re built on an assumption which is easily testable and false in my tests so far: &quot;DOT com has an SEO advantage&#8230;&quot;<br><br>As an easy one to look at, I did a logged-out search for [seo plugin for wordpress].

This gives the visitor the impression that the plugin isn&#8217;t available for free elsewhere, because there is no link back to WordPress.org with an explanation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:21px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2402\" height=\"1118\" data-attachment-id=\"148876\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/developers-claim-damaged-trust-following-public-confrontations-with-wordpress-leadership/screen-shot-2023-09-15-at-10-26-00-am\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2402,1118\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-300x140.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-500x233.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148876\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM.png 2402w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-300x140.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-500x233.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-768x357.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-1536x715.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-15-at-10.26.00-AM-2048x953.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2402px) 100vw, 2402px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many WordPress.org plugin authors were not aware until recently that their plugin pages are being scraped for use on WordPress.com. Yesterday, <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/articles/patchstack-is-free-on-the-official-wordpress-repository/\">Patchstack updated its readme file</a> to ensure that WordPress.com users and visitors are made aware that the plugin is available for free in the official WordPress plugin repository, using the following text: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>This plugin can be downloaded for free without any paid subscription from&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the official WordPress repository.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was at a Python conference last week and a guy came to our booth and said he has a WordPress site but he hasen’t been able to purchase any plugins yet,&#8221; Patchstack CEO Oliver Sild said. &#8220;I told him that they are all free, and then it turned out he had a WordPress.com site where he has to pay to install any plugins. These people think that THIS IS the WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked if WordPress.com could at least link back to the .org plugin for logged-out views to eliminate some of the confusion, Mullenweg confirmed that he told Sild that WordPress.com would work on adding links to the .org equivalent page this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But that confusion that people claim is causing huge issues for WordPress isn&#8217;t supported by the numbers or growth of non-.com solutions over 17 years now,&#8221; Mullenweg said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So at some point we should stop accepting it as within our top 100 issues for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s much more likely like a road bump for some newbies, than an actual blocker, not unlike learning the difference between categories and tags, or how to identify a normal-looking comment that&#8217;s actually spam.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1702391616764289222\">response</a> to WordPress developer Daniel Schutzsmith saying that WordPress.com is causing confusion for OSS, Mullenweg contended that it &#8220;creates a false dichotomy between WP on .com and &#8216;open source software.&#8217; Every site on .com is part of the OSS community as much as on any other host. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When there is confusion, it assumes that it&#8217;s a top issue for WordPress. Nothing about WP&#8217;s growth, including vis a vis other projects, indicates that the existence of a .com and .org with the same name has held us back.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In support of his claims about the growth of non-WordPress.com solutions, he cited a W3Techs report on hosting company usage stats with extrapolated revenue on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a> Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:28px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1226\" height=\"1634\" data-attachment-id=\"148881\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/developers-claim-damaged-trust-following-public-confrontations-with-wordpress-leadership/image-11\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png\" data-orig-size=\"1226,1634\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-225x300.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-375x500.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148881\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png 1226w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-225x300.png 225w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-375x500.png 375w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-768x1024.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1152x1536.png 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;On revenue: If you extrapolate out public domain numbers with plan pricing, and look at public filings like the amount GoDaddy makes from hosting and what % of that hosting is WP-powered, you pretty quickly see that GoDaddy, Newfold/Bluehost, Siteground, Hostinger, and WP Engine make more than .com from WordPress hosting.,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;You can check out those companies on the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledges/?order=hours\" target=\"_blank\">five for the future page</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-identifies-godaddy-as-a-parasitic-company-and-an-existential-threat-to-wordpress-future\">previously criticized large hosting companies</a> for what he perceives to be a lack of support for the open source WordPress and WooCommerce projects in proportion to how much they benefit from the use of these platforms. His comments in Post Status yesterday indicate that while he is still unsatisfied with their core contributions, he acknowledges these companies as important to WordPress&#8217; overall growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By the way, despite not looking great for core contributions, I think each of those companies has been&nbsp;<em>essential</em>&nbsp;for the growth of WordPress, and particularly the work they invest into upgrade PHP, MySQL, core auto-updates, plugin auto-updates, and security are crucial for the health of our ecosystem,&#8221; Mullenweg said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;cynically cool&#8217; to hate on some of the bigger ones, but it&#8217;s a free and open market, none of their WP users are locked in and could easily switch to other hosts if they weren&#8217;t happy with the price and value they were getting. In fact by that measure, you could argue they&#8217;ve all done a much better job than .com at connecting with customers. Maybe I spend too much of .com&#8217;s engineering and investment on things like 2fa/passkeys, reader/notifications, stats, the mobile apps, Gutenberg, and Calypso and not enough on marketing or paying off affiliate host review sites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Damaging Community Impact of Public Confrontations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg continued to be active on Post Status Slack and X (Twitter) throughout the day, attempting to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1702341579850055809\">debunk claims</a> that Automattic is exploiting open source contributors for profit. These interactions included <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1702403896562352285\">personal attacks</a> which followed after Mullenweg blocked WordPress Marketing Team co-rep Sé Reed who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sereedmedia/status/1702032589287211305\">claimed</a> that he is standing in the way of contributors improving the open source project and that he was &#8220;vilifying, dismissing, and insulting&#8221; the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some perceived him blocking Reed as him shutting down criticism, despite the fact that he said this is the first person he has ever blocked on Twitter. Although her comments were tangential to the original issue (the impact of the WordPress.com plugin listings), they became a focal point after Mullenweg lashed out at developer and product owner Dan Cameron who accused him of &#8220;actively doing more harm than good.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dan, you&#39;ve built the Search Everything plugin which was popular early on, at some point got sold to Zemanta and abandoned.

I don’t have any idea how I’d handle being criticized so heavily for years by the people who built businesses and careers on a project that I helped bring in to the world, but it probably would be a lot worse than calling a few people out on Twitter.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others who gathered in various Slack instances, watching things play out on Twitter, felt collectively traumatized by witnessing the interactions between Mullenweg and different community members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think Matt did way more damage this time than ever before,&#8221; one prominent WordPress consultant said, requesting to remain anonymous.  &#8220;It generated good but quite wearied and sad expressions of grief and anguish in my company Slack and no doubt many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The instantly and deeply (however crudely researched) personal nature of Matt’s attacks leads people to paranoid fears that he has a shitlist of enemies who are just regular people, not giant companies etc. It’s a fearsome kind of punching down where the community gets stuck in the psychological position of the children of an abusive parent. Different personalities and different perspectives based on our own experiences lead us to different coping responses. But it’s very ugly now to have the paranoia confirmed as Matt basically taunted the fact that he feeds on what he’s told second or third hand about things others say about him in private.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Cromwell, Senior Director of Customer Experience at StellarWP, said that discussions that start and stay on X/Twitter generally have very little fruit, especially when resolving something as complicated as the WordPress.com plugins SEO issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The community keeps leaning on this platform for these discussions but things like the impact of duplicate content on two sites both called &#8216;WordPress&#8217; requires more nuanced and trusting conversations which Twitter can&#8217;t provide,&#8221; Cromwell said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Mullenweg used the whole thing as an excuse to make so many of the plugin owners that drive WP adoption feel small. It was extremely hurtful to the trust product owners put into the leadership of the WP project. I expect to see more product owners prefer to build SaaS integrations with WP rather than dedicated products because they don&#8217;t trust that Mullenweg has their mutual interest in mind at all anymore – and I don&#8217;t see a way for him to ever put that genie back in the bottle after this behavior both on Twitter and in Post Status Slack.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer and contributor Alex Standiford said Mullenweg&#8217;s public confrontations yesterday are &#8220;a bad look for WordPress, and deflate the passionate contributors who genuinely believe in WordPress.&#8221; Despite recent events, he continues to believe in the larger impact of people building open source software together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I believe that WordPress isn&#8217;t software,&#8221; Standiford <a href=\"https://alexstandiford.com/micro/2294\">wrote on his blog</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s not community. It&#8217;s not a single person, no matter how significant that person thinks they are. I believe that WordPress is the manifestation of a belief that the web is at its best when it&#8217;s open. If I genuinely believed that forking WordPress would be good for WordPress, and the web, I&#8217;d contribute to it over the existing platform in a heartbeat.&#8221;</p>\n",

The community will vote throughout the first two days of WooSesh and the winners will be announced on the final day. Winners will receive a digital badge of recognition and Richards said he is also working on producing physical awards to ship to winners anywhere in the world.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>WordPress core developer John Blackbourn sparked a heated discussion yesterday when he posted an image of his WordPress User Switching plugin ranking higher for the WordPress.com listing than the page on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpressdotcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wordpressdotcom</a> replicated the entire <a href=\"https://t.co/oTA9NDVkFk\">https://t.co/oTA9NDVkFk</a> plugin directory on its .com domain name? Searching for some plugin names now results in the .com page ranking higher than .org. Fuck the long term health of the FOSS project, let&#39;s make some money, right? <a href=\"https://t.co/UD40BN3Z6g\">pic.twitter.com/UD40BN3Z6g</a></p>&mdash; John Blackbourn (@johnbillion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1701765939534893475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 13, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackbourn later apologized for the inflammatory wording of the original post, but maintains that .com plugin listings being displayed higher in search results is not healthy for the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This was a frustrated 2AM tweet so I could have worded it better, but the point still stands,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The plugin pages on dotcom are little more than marketing landing pages for the dotcom service and they&#8217;re strongly competing with the canonical dotorg pages. That&#8217;s not healthy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several others <a href=\"https://twitter.com/konstruktors/status/1701851307454185628\">commented</a> about having <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1693475484734239\">similar experiences</a> when searching for plugins, finding that the WordPress.com often ranks higher, although many others still see WordPress.org pages ranked highest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackbourn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1702035969237504140\">said</a> his chief concern &#8220;is the process that introduced the directory clone on .com either disregarded its potential impact on .org in favor of inbounds or never considered it in the first place &#8211; both very concerning given the ranking power of .com.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tweet highlighted the frustration some members of the open source community feel due to the perennial branding confusion between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. Nothing short of renaming WordPress.com will eliminate the longstanding confusion, but this is unlikely as Automattic benefits from tightly coupling its products to WordPress’ name recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Duplicate content confuses the human + search engines,&#8221; SEO consultant Rebecca Gill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccagill/status/1702022257533493726\">said</a>. &#8220;Search engines won&#8217;t like it, nor will humans trying to find solutions to their problems. There is already enough confusion w/ .org + .com for non-tech folks. This amplifies it.

He elaborated on how the cloned plugin directory is integrated with Calypso, WordPress.com&#8217;s admin interface:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>.com has its own plugin directory which includes the .org one, it provides more installs and distribution to the plugin authors, which helps their usage and for commercial ones gets them more sales. The plugins are not altered. .com takes no cut for the distribution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When participants in the discussion suggested that other hosts doing the same thing would create a wild west situation for plugin rankings, Mullenweg said he would not mind if the plugins were &#8220;duplicated and distributed by every host and site on the planet,&#8221; as they are all licensed under the GPL.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If people are providing more distribution to unaltered plugins, I think that&#39;s great.

Controversial, I know. But I prefer we build together instead of alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I fail to see how this is not an advantage to anyone who hosts their plugins (for FREE) on w[dot]org ?&#8221; Raiber continued in a separate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CristianRaiber/status/1701991457412767913\">response</a>. &#8220;Is it about being outranked in Google&#8217;s SERPs for brand kws?

I want <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://t.co/lvD51DFwBI\" target=\"_blank\">wp.com</a> to make money so they keep growing this product.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XWP Director of Engineering Francesca Marano suggested that WordPress.com has benefitted from the branding and reputation of .org, which is built by volunteers. She also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancescaMarano/status/1701928039599219066\">proposed</a> that Automattic &#8220;has the resources to do a whole rebranding which would ultimately benefit both projects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1701978533239640196\">responded</a> to these comments, defending WordPress.com&#8217;s efforts in fending off early WordPress competitors and cited Automattic&#8217;s preeminence in contributing back to core, despite taking in less revenue than some larger companies making money from the software:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Since its foundation, .org has benefitted from the branding and reputation of having a robust SaaS version available from .com, including a free version, something basically no other host does. Over 200M people have used it, and countless started on .com and then migrated to another host. The shared branding made it very difficult for services like Typepad to compete. You want to see what WP would look like without it? Go to Joomla. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>.com has also been the source of countless performance improvements, we deploy pre-release versions of core to millions of sites to find bugs and do testing, making WP releases way more stable for regular users and hosts. <strong><em>No company contributes more, even though many make more from WP than .com&#8217;s revenue.</em></strong> It would have been way easier to fork the software, not merge MU. Most hosts (and many community members) bad-mouth .com while not contributing a fraction back to core. Hosts spend tens of millions a year on ads against .com. I get attacked constantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, when the WordPress Foundation was created, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/book/2015/11/the-wordpress-foundation/#:~:text=Automattic%20had%20always%20intended%20to,company's%20investors%20at%20the%20outset.\">Automattic transferred the WordPress trademarks to the Foundation</a>, after having been the temporary custodian of the trademarks until that time. As part of the transfer, the Foundation granted Mullenweg use of the WordPress trademark for WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trademark was deliberately secured, and the company does not appear to be open to renaming the platform. This doesn&#8217;t mean WordPress.com can&#8217;t do anything to mitigate the confusion that scraping the WordPress.org plugin directory creates. Participants in the discussion suggested that WordPress.com forego indexing the pages they created for plugins that developers submitted to the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You can control SEO by telling search engines to not index those pages of open source software developed for .org on the .com domain,&#8221; WordPress plugin developer Marco Almeida <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wonderm00n/status/1701905853165551802\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have 20 free plugins on the repository and I don&#8217;t see how my plugins will benefit if we open this pandora box and normalize cloning these pages and diluting the WordPress.org importance on search engines.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dotcom can help by using schema markup that points to dotorg as the authority (using the &quot;about&quot; and/or &quot;sameAs&quot; properties).

As long as a commercial entity shares the open source project&#8217;s branding, these types of clashes and friction will continue popping up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I can’t help but empathize with plugin authors that chose to support OSS and find the directory cloned in a commercial service, albeit free, with no access to stats,&#8221; Francesca Marano <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancescaMarano/status/1702001376442700283\">said</a>. &#8220;As I mentioned before, the main issue is the confusion around the two projects.&#8221; </p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>It has be nearly one year since <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-removes-active-install-growth-data-for-plugins\">WordPress silently turned off active install growth data for plugins</a> hosted in the official plugin repository, a key metric that many developers rely on for accurate tracking and product decision-making. “Insufficient data obfuscation” was cited as the reason for the charts’ removal, but this opaque decision landed without any communication from those who had made the call in a private discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a ticket originally titled “<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">Bring back the active install growth chart,</a>” RebelCode CEO Mark Zahra made the opening plea for thousands of plugin developers who were asking for the return of this data. From those who simply host hobby plugins and enjoy the thrill of watching people use software they made to business owners who need this data to make critical decisions, the overwhelming consensus was that this data is valuable and should be available to those who are contributing to WordPress through plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wpwatercooler.com/wpwatercooler/ep432-solutions-to-the-active-growth-problem/\">WPwatercooler podcast</a> last year, Audrey Capital-sponsored meta contributor Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood confirmed the decision was made through private channels via Slack DMs in a discussion initiated by Matt Mullenweg. He also revealed that the active install growth chart was removed because it was giving inaccurate data and that the data one could derive from it was inaccurate:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I read through all that discussion and we worked, they worked on it for a long, Scott and several people tried various things before removing it. They adjusted the values, they adjusted numbers. They, they went through a ridiculous amount of iteration and in the end, none of it worked. People were still using it even though it was giving them basically garbage. So finally removing it was the only thing to do. We did have a plan for replacing it. We just didn’t have a plan for replacing it immediately. Nevertheless, giving them active install count numbers that are wrong is more harmful, we felt, to both users and developers interests than simply not giving them at all.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood offered an explanation on the podcast that should have been delivered weeks earlier by those involved in the discussion on official channels. Despite the earlier data being flawed and &#8220;insufficiently obfuscated,&#8221; developers still want access to the raw data, not interpretations of that data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the posts that track the history and development of developers&#8217; pleas to reinstate access to the data:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:21px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-removes-active-install-growth-data-for-plugins\">WordPress.org Removes Active Install Growth Data for Plugins</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-plugin-developers-demand-transparency-regarding-the-removal-of-active-install-growth-data\">WordPress.org Plugin Developers Demand Transparency Regarding the Removal of Active Install Growth Data</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors\">Discussion on Replacing Plugin Active Install Growth Data Continues Behind Closed Doors</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>During the height of this discussion, developers made many suggestions for different data points that would be meaningful for tracking their efforts, and Matt Mullenweg responded that he was amenable to showing more stats to plugin authors about their plugins. No progress on this effort has been reported since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;StellarWP&nbsp;Product Marketing Director&nbsp;Taylor Waldon has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tElizaRose/status/1699134532199538877\">reopened this discussion</a> nearly a year later, calling on Mullenweg to stop restricting access to plugin data from people who are hosting themes and plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <br><br>Without (real) Active Install data, we are not able to measure the success of our free product.

The document describes a common scenario where plugin developers are left in the dark about the growth or decline of their plugins&#8217; active installations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Imagine a developer with a plugin with 150k active installations. That developer has effectively 0 quantitative feedback on whether users of his plugin are growing or falling. The download count has a trend, but there is no separation between new downloads and updates. The download count tracks developmental pace as much as user growth. A bump in downloads could be due to a security vulnerability being patched or an influx of new users. The current active installations count is severely rounded and offers no feedback until such a plugin either gains or loses 33% of its users, which are drastically different outcomes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Coleman contends that plugins hosted outside of WordPress.org are able to gather more meaningful metrics. Popular plugins have resorted to including features in non-WordPress.org add-ons or simply removing their extensions altogether from the repository for lack of data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His proposal includes a few metrics that would help developers better track their plugins, even if that data is only shown to the authors themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Share a more accurate active installations count with the owners of a plugin.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share more accurate version number counts with the owners of a plugin.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Differentiate the download count by type: website downloads, dashboard installs, dashboard downloads, updates, other (hits to the zip file).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow plugin developers to define custom event triggers to be tallied and displayed to the plugin owners on the plugins .org profile page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Coleman&#8217;s draft is still in progress and so far he is the only one who has authored the document. If the recommended actions gain any traction, he said he hopes to be part of the contributor team that implements the changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The intention was to write something that could be proposed to meta team,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;But honestly, I thought I would write it up, it would get shot down, and then I could move on with my life. Even if nothing got updated, it would be more clear to me and others which parts of the .org code were in public repositories and which were in the private repositories. It would be more clear what the real issues are with the active installs count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The communication around the removal of the active install growth chart caused many to lose trust in parts of the WordPress .org project. I thought some clarity around how things work and the real reasons around the changes would help to rebuild some of that trust that was lost.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org has always been the most popular distribution channel for the most widely used plugins, but the data available has not kept pace with developer and business needs. Releasing the raw data, while respecting any privacy limitations, would allow developers to extract their own interpretations of that data and allow services to present it in creative ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, this data should be available to developers (even if it&#8217;s not public) to help them better track the trajectory of their plugins and the efficacy of their marketing efforts. More data can only serve to improve the WordPress ecosystem&#8217;s ability to continue powering a multi-billion dollar economy. There are undoubtedly many technical requirements for supporting the release of this data, and they need to be prioritized if WordPress.org is to continue attracting the best products for distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is not about vanity metrics or inflating numbers for marketing purposes,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;This is about getting valuable feedback on the relative use of a plugin hosted in the .org repository so developers can make informed decisions and investments in those plugins.&#8221;</p>\n",

As examples, while we’ve each done CRM and CDP integration work and strategy, I’d imagine a first rate CRM and/or CDP consultancy with some great case studies and clients would be the kind of opportunity that would be particularly interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open Source Contribution Will Continue To Be a Priority at 10up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 12 years after Goldman started 10up with what he said was &#8220;a small personal savings account and the sweat equity of more than a decade making websites and other media,&#8221; he is no longer the sole leader of the organization and will take on the role of Partner in the merged companies. Integral to the success of 10up, which Goldman has scaled to $40M+ in annual revenue, is its consistent commitment to supporting the open source ecosystem from which it has derived millions of dollars in value. Fueled acknowledged this in its <a href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/fueled-merges-with-10up/\">announcement</a> about the merger:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>10up has long held a commitment to the open web, and open source contributions as a core value. This will remain a priority, especially towards the WordPress community, and will be further strengthened by the additional market reach gained from the merger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fueled shares this same ethos, which they intend to continue cultivating following the merger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fueled has always been supportive of open source, even if their part of the market (mobile apps) hasn&#8217;t embraced that model in the way web CMS has,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;They have open sourced projects (in fact, we incidentally found that we were using one!), and, like 10up, have fully embraced and focused on open technology solutions like NodeJS and React for web applications.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most recent WordPress 6.3 release, <a href=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2023/08/contribution-stats-for-wordpress-6-3-lionel/#:~:text=WordPress%206.3%20overall%20stats,which%20is%20a%20great%20ratio!\">10up had the second most contributions by company</a>, with 290 contributions from 16 people, superseded only by Automattic, which boasts 83 contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2019/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wp63-contributor-company.svg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">image credit: <a href=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2023/08/contribution-stats-for-wordpress-6-3-lionel/#:~:text=WordPress%206.3%20overall%20stats,which%20is%20a%20great%20ratio!\">WordPress 6.3 contribution stats</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>10up has consistently been among the top contributors to the software, which has been essential to the world-class publishing experiences the company has built for its clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That commitment to giving back to the web, making sure there&#8217;s a ladder for the next generation of developers to climb, and helping open technologies thrive remains with us,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;Our new business partners understand that this is deeply intertwined with 10up&#8217;s identity, and perhaps more importantly, our <em>success</em>. It&#8217;s not <em>just</em> a generosity thing – it&#8217;s also good business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Merging with and investing in 10up would be pretty foolish if you aren&#8217;t comfortable with the tools and platforms we use and prefer, most especially the web&#8217;s most popular open source CMS, and you can bet that being comfortable with that, and researching that question, was essential to their comfort with merging. In many ways, that&#8217;s a validation for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10up and Fueled Will Gradually Merge Services and Administration, Pursuing Large Scale Digital Transformation Clients</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>10up and Fueled will largely operate as two companies and close partners for the time being, sharing leads and pursuing customer growth together. Goldman said the vision is not to simply have web publishing/WordPress customers and separate mobile app customers but rather to go after large scale digital transformation projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That means having a fully integrated way to deliver everything from the mobile apps, to the website and CMS, to advanced e-commerce and CRM integrations (even if we may only provide one of those services to some clients),&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means we&#8217;re not just operating as separate companies in the <em>future</em>, but truly merging and unifying our companies from leadership and sales on down through project and product management, user research and design, and engineering delivery.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that both brands hold considerable weight and influence in their respective markets, Goldman said they agreed &#8220;it would be incredibly foolish to discount that and rush to a single brand.&#8221; Instead, they plan to explore how the companies can work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We honestly don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;ll land on the external brand question, and didn&#8217;t think it was fundamental to the question of merging,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be exploring and researching that question together, and any change would, again, be gradual and planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We all similarly agree that when we think out into the future, whether that&#8217;s 12 or 24 months from now (probably something in between), that we probably don&#8217;t want two separate, external, top line company brands competing for attention and oxygen in the space, to say nothing of competing for internal focus and resources.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that could play out in a number of ways, and may be a data driven decision. For example, 10up could evolve to be the brand name for the WordPress engineering services team or the company&#8217;s open source and productized solutions. Nothing has been predetermined about the branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, it appears to that the combination of companies will be a more gradual merging of services and administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the mid term, maybe the next year, we want to focus on building a highly collaborative world class sales and growth operation, unifying back office (benefits management, financial operations, recruiting ops, etc), and looking at where some of our smaller capabilities and disciplines that aren&#8217;t very specific to 10up or Fueled delivery might benefit from joining forces and achieving some economy of scale,&#8221; Goldman said.</p>\n",

It was founded by Human Made COO Siobhan McKeown and XWP Director of Engineering Francesca Marano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in WordPress a long time and I&#8217;ve met a lot of talented women but not enough in leadership roles. It&#8217;s time to change that,&#8221; McKeown said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The website states the founders&#8217; mission in launching the initiative:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Disappointed by the lack of representation of women in leadership roles at companies in the WordPress ecosystem we’ve decided to do something about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to drastically increase representation of women in leadership roles at WordPress companies. We will do this by mentoring and supporting women to take the next step in their careers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Includes is recruiting women leaders who are C-Level or Directors <br>at a WordPress company to volunteer as mentors and build a supportive network of mentees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mentorship program lasts five months and calls for mentees/mentors goes out twice a year in September and March. Mentors commit to meet with mentees for a 1:1 on a regular basis and support them in achieving their goals. Mentee applicants are required to be working at a business in the WordPress ecosystem and actively developing their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Includes is accepting sponsorships from companies with some rigorous requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Acknowledge gender disparity and a lack of representation in your organization, wherever it exists.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proactively address gender disparity in your leadership and executive roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When senior roles become available, actively seek to place women within those roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support women within their career in your organization, working to ensure that any gender-related barriers are removed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create opportunities to showcase women leaders in your organisation so that they can act as role models for future leaders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Supporting organizations can also contribute by sharing open roles within the network and by providing mentorship to future leaders who may potentially be considered for leadership roles in the sponsoring organizations. This is effectively changing representation from the inside out with cooperating organizations contributing to the cultivation of the leaders they need in order to purse more diverse leadership teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospective mentees, mentors, and sponsors can apply on the <a href=\"https://wpincludes.me/\">WP Includes website</a>. </p>\n",

Although ACF reports more than 4.5 million active users, including PRO site installs, the survey only gathered feedback from 2,031 respondents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results are more representative of the plugin&#8217;s developer community, as 81% of respondents are developers who maintain between 11-50 websites. 63% use version control for their codebase, and 27% manage dependencies with Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey showed that ACF is still an important tool for its early adopters, as 50% said they have been using it since its early days and 70% of all respondents use the plugin on all the websites they build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what type of sites they are building, respondents had the option to choose multiple answers. Sites using Classic WordPress themes are the most popular followed by Hybrid themes, Block themes, and page builders.

Users can then reposition the blocks after insertion using the editor tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53987#issuecomment-1695915874\">proposed</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54147\">renaming</a> the feature to block hooks to help developers understand how they work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen anecdotal feedback that <code>autoInsert</code> is not the clearest of descriptions,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to propose renaming to the more familiar <code>hooks</code> terminology—and &#8216;block hooks&#8217; in more general terms—to help folks understand the mechanics and purpose more rapidly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52969\">adds an inspector panel for block hooks</a>, tentatively named &#8220;Plugins,&#8221; that displays blocks available for auto-insertion. It includes toggles to insert or remove them. The updated version of the feature also includes block icons (not shown below) to help differentiate the toggles. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1443\" height=\"438\" data-attachment-id=\"148604\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-6-introduces-block-hooks-improvements-to-toolbars-on-nested-blocks/block-hooks\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/block-hooks.gif\" data-orig-size=\"1443,438\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"block-hooks\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/block-hooks-300x91.gif\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/block-hooks-500x152.gif\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/block-hooks.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148604\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">image source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52969#issuecomment-1669889491\">Gutenberg repository PR #52969</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 16.6 brings improvements to toolbars on nested blocks, where the toolbar now stays attached to the parent block. This change is part of a broader effort to improve nested block experiences. Previously, the toolbar would move around when clicking inside the nested blocks, but this change makes it stay in place for a less chaotic editing experience. The updated toolbar behavior has been rolled out to Navigation, List, and Quote blocks so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/260811408-8ad934d1-043c-4c04-bc13-9bb2256bde6a.mp4\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">video credit: Gutenberg GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53699\">PR #53699</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes a new keyboard shortcut for duplicating blocks within the List View: (<code>CMD+Shift+d</code>). It enables users to do more from the keyboard while navigating around the List View, instead of having to jump back into the block settings menu or editor canvas.

      "content": "\n<p>WooCommerce is experimenting with improving the store experience through the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/8219\">addition of the Interactivity API</a> to the WooCommerce Blocks plugin. The new API, which was announced earlier this year, will allow developers to build interactive blocks that support frontend experiences where visitors can interact with content without having to refresh the page. The WordPress contributors working on the API are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/start-testing-wordpress-new-interactivity-api\">encouraging developers to test it</a> with their own blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/08/16/woocommerce-blocks-10-9-0-release-notes/?mc_cid=b50d0ff43c&amp;mc_eid=68ffa9a210\">WooCommerce Blocks 10.9.0</a>, released in mid-August, integrated the Product Button with the Interactivity API to support real-time counter updates for the mini-cart, smoother animations, and better transitions from ‘Add to Cart’ to ‘Loading’ status to show the quantity in the cart when a product is added. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/256799240-f8b16c63-49a7-4448-8553-3c81b8d85844.mp4\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">WooCommerce Blocks <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10006\">PR #10006</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is subtle but creates a much smoother shopping experience with nearly instantaneous feedback for the user. Contributors are also exploring how the Interactivity API can be used to improve frontend filters, including the rating, price, stock, and attributes filters. The API will eventually land in Gutenberg and WordPress in the future, but in the meantime WooCommerce is experimenting to see how the plugin&#8217;s blocks can benefit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/08/31/woocommerce-blocks-11-0-0-release-notes/\">Version 11.0.0</a> was released last week introducing the new Product Collection block in beta:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Like the Products block, you can choose what criteria affect the list of blocks displayed to shoppers and control the product layout in the list/grid by the various element blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Products block, which is a Query loop block variation, this block is a standalone block, enabling us to tailor the block further to better meet the merchant’s needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Product Collection block is very similar to the Products block from which it was forked, except it is not built as a variation of the Query Loop. It comes with improvements around Inspector controls as compared to the current Products block, as well as a basic set of patterns. The block already has the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/10328\">Interactivity API integrated</a> for the same improved frontend performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2047\" height=\"1584\" data-attachment-id=\"148556\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-blocks-11-0-0-adds-product-collection-block-in-beta-10-9-0-integrates-product-button-with-the-interactivity-api/product-collection\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection.webp\" data-orig-size=\"2047,1584\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"product-collection\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection-300x232.webp\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection-500x387.webp\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148556\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection.webp 2047w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection-300x232.webp 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection-500x387.webp 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection-768x594.webp 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection-1536x1189.webp 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Product Collection block &#8211; image source: <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/08/31/woocommerce-blocks-11-0-0-release-notes/\">WooCommerce Blocks 11.0.0 release post</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.0.0 also enables manual migration of Products to Product Collection.

At the first event, the agency showcased some early work in the <a href=\"https://www.altis-dxp.com/accelerate/\">Altis Accelerate</a> plugin and have been working with clients to determine how AI can augment existing marketing and editorial workflows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The progress and innovation we’re seeing in AI is so rapid at the moment that it kind of demands you stay close to it, keep following what’s happening, and keep learning,&#8221; Human Made Marketing Director Alex Aspinall said. &#8220;AI is one of our core areas of focus, across all parts of the business, so we’ll definitely be building, sharing, and hosting more in the space in the months to come. Doing all this in the open is really important to us, so the events are a great platform.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first event, Aspinall reports that Human Made saw registrations and participation across a wide range of business verticals and role disciplines, with conversations continuing months after the first event. <br><br>&#8220;While there are a few businesses and individuals building things, experimenting, and commercializing their work in the area, the vast majority are still finding their way through, figuring out how best to implement AI to deliver tangible benefit to their companies, their clients, their teams, and their day-to-day lives,&#8221; Aspinall said.<br><br>&#8220;Despite the level of advancement we’ve already seen, we’re still right at the start of this thing, which is really exciting. There’s a lot to learn, and considerable edge available for those experimenting and putting things in place. Imagine what we’ll be talking about this time next year!&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Kevin Ohashi from Review Signal&nbsp;has published his <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/\">2023 WordPress and WooCommerce hosting performance benchmarks</a>. This is his 10th round of capturing performance data from hosting companies that opt into the testing. Ohashi&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/methodology/\">methodology</a> tests two metrics through a variety of methods: peak performance and consistency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benchmarks include a LoadStorm test designed to simulate real users visiting the site, logging in, and browsing (uncached performance). They also test cached performance, SSL, WP queries per second, performance on some computational and database operations, and a WebPageTest that fully loads the homepage and records how long it takes from 12 different locations around the world. As part of the consistency testing, Ohashi also measures uptime using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hetrixtools.com/uptime-monitor/166399.html\" target=\"_blank\">HetrixTools</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://uptimerobot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uptime Robot</a> for a minimum of three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants pay a standard, publicly documented fee, based on the price tier of the product being tested, to cover the costs. Ohashi does not accept sponsorships for the tests, and has become one of the most trusted sources for unbiased performance reviews of WordPress hosting plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, Ohashi tested 31 companies across 72 plans and seven pricing tiers, with tests nearly identical to previous years. He made minimal adjustments to the LoadStorm test script to improve performance and make it compatible with newer versions of k6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The website makes it easy to review results at a glance by using a star system. Hosts that achieve &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; status receive a full star:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>This is awarded to companies who maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the entire testing and show little to no performance degradation during load testing, primarily focused on error rate and consistent response times. Error rates above 0.1% and response times above 1000ms* will keep a company away from achieving Top Tier marks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The half star indicates &#8220;Honorable Mention&#8221; status, which is given to companies that came close to Top Tier but fell just short, such as struggling slightly on a load test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among budget hosts in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-25-wordpress/\">&lt;$25/month category</a>, the majority of hosts (16/21) rang in at the Top Tier level. Those who did not earn Top Tier status were held back by inferior performance on the the LoadStorm test&nbsp;for the most part, even though several still took top scores in other aspects of the testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1222\" height=\"1194\" data-attachment-id=\"148428\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/review-signal-publishes-2023-wordpress-and-woocommerce-hosting-performance-benchmarks/screen-shot-2023-09-01-at-11-58-44-am\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM.png\" data-orig-size=\"1222,1194\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM-300x293.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM-500x489.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148428\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM.png 1222w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM-300x293.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM-500x489.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM-768x750.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are fewer participants at the $25-50 plan (and other more expensive plans) but the results are similar to the budget hosts, with A2 Hosting, Cloudways, and Stromonic edged out of contention for Top Tier. All three failed to achieve Top Tier for any of the plans tested this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-enterprise-wordpress/\">Enterprise tier ($500+)</a>, the majority of participants handled the LoadStorm test without issue. When testing cached performance, Ohashi found that the overall field of participants is getting faster: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Excluding Seravo, every company was 33ms average or below and 43ms p95 or below. Compared to last year where the fastest average was 6.4 ms and p95 was 20ms. There are four companies this year below both of those levels. The performance at the Enterprise tier is mind bogglingly fast and getting even faster which is hard to comprehend when last year&#8217;s 6.4ms was beaten by 4 plans this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2094\" height=\"1304\" data-attachment-id=\"148433\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/review-signal-publishes-2023-wordpress-and-woocommerce-hosting-performance-benchmarks/screen-shot-2023-09-01-at-1-13-36-pm\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2094,1304\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-300x187.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-500x311.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148433\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM.png 2094w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-300x187.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-500x311.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-768x478.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-1536x957.png 1536w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM-2048x1275.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2094px) 100vw, 2094px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the entrants in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce category</a> earned Top Tier status, with the exception of Blallo and Cloudways, both of which stumbled on the LoadStorm test.

They also don&#8217;t take into account other aspects of the WordPress hosting experience, like reviews, support, and features. Ohashi tests the defaults for all of these plans, but if there are more optimization features that can be customized for sites (which are not clearly outlined in the initial setup) then those are also not taken into account. The methodology simply focuses on performance, so it&#8217;s just one factor of hosting, albeit a very important one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As far as surprising results, I keep thinking &#8216;Are we nearing the point that we won&#8217;t see much improvement?&#8217; and each year the whole field gets faster and faster,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;Even improving on sub 10ms times between years. For example, in the &lt;$25/month tier, in 2022 there were 3 companies with &lt;50ms average response time on the Static k6 test. This year there are 10. I also saw 100ms+ improvements from the other (slower) side bringing up the whole field a meaningful amount. Everyone is getting faster and faster.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Some Managed WordPress Hosting Companies Missing?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many leading WordPress managed hosts that are notably absent from Ohashi&#8217;s benchmarks, whose inclusion would be helpful for a deeper understanding of market. I asked him about a handful of them and he reported that WP Engine, DreamHost, and Kinsta declined to participate this year, to name a few. GoDaddy took a year off but may be back next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major reasons for hosts not wanting to participate fall into a few categories, and bad performance is chief among them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some companies perform poorly or poorly relative to price and don&#8217;t want to participate anymore,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;They usually talk about other &#8216;intangible&#8217; values that you can&#8217;t measure. I think good performance should be a default for every&nbsp;hosting company, and good companies shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of bad results &#8211; if they actually plan on improving their services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But some would probably rather spend fortunes on marketing instead of better engineering, and bad results aren&#8217;t going to help their&nbsp;marketing. I personally love seeing companies who participate year after year despite mixed results. I respect the companies&nbsp;who consistently earn Top Tier are doing a great job. But there&#8217;s something special about companies willing to put themselves out there regardless of the results, because it&#8217;s a public and open commitment to improving.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said that occasionally the timing doesn&#8217;t work out where a host is going through a major engineering overhaul during the testing and doesn&#8217;t want the platform benchmarked when they are about to release a new one. In this case some opt to skip a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs of the benchmarking can also be prohibitive for some smaller hosting companies. Ohashi raised prices by $250 across all tiers this year (eg. $100-&gt;$350, $500-&gt;$750) to cover his costs. Although this doesn&#8217;t seem like much for a hosting company, they also have to pay for the servers for four months, and have the staff/resources available to work with Ohashi on organizing, executing, and debugging issues. 20i, Krystal Hosting, Nexcess, and Pressable agreed to sponsor upstart companies in the space for 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason some hosts don&#8217;t participate is a lack of interest or value. They don&#8217;t see how they can use the benchmark results to their advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some companies don&#8217;t get as much value from the benchmarks as others,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;Performance across the board has gone way up. It&#8217;s harder and harder to stand out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think some companies may view it as an instant validation and reason for customers to come busting down the doors. But there are a lot of great companies offering great performance. Earning Top Tier status means you&#8217;ve got a performant hosting platform. It&#8217;s great, and it can help validate some customer needs/desires in the decision making funnel, but it won&#8217;t magically generate tons of sales.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said he has put together notes for hosting companies that earned Top Tier status to help them leverage more value this year from a marketing perspective, based on what he has seen some companies do with their results. Creating more value for participating companies is something he is actively working to improve upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Review Signal had approximately 35,000 people visit in the past year, Ohashi doesn&#8217;t think the traffic captures the full value of the benchmarks very well. The people who dig into these metrics are those who have a large impact on where their WordPress clients host their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The people who care about the benchmarks are seriously into WordPress / hosting / performance,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of agencies, developers, large website owners and hosting people. One way I&#8217;ve measured impact is by going to the major WordCamps (EU/Asia/US) and talking to people. The number of folks who are aware of the benchmarks there was surprisingly&nbsp;high to me. The people who are interested enough to spend time at WordCamps are the same folks interested in reading the benchmarks. It&#8217;s not the largest number of people who read them, but it is the largest impact people who read and value them.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>After an in-depth performance analysis earlier this year revealed that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-analysis-finds-translations-may-significantly-slow-down-sites\">translations can impact server response times</a>, WordPress contributors <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/24/i18n-performance-analysis/\">proposed</a> half a dozen technical solutions for consideration to improve performance for the ~56% of sites that use translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a>, a feature project by the core Performance Team, is now available as a plugin on WordPress.org. It incorporates some of the proposed solutions and speeds up translations by converting <code>.mo</code> files to <code>.php</code> files, allowing them to be parsed faster and stored in <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php\">OPcache</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It supports multiple file formats (<code>.mo</code>, <code>.php</code>, and <code>.json</code>) and multiple text domains and locales loaded at the same time. Existing <code>.mo</code> files get converted to <code>.php</code> files which are then loaded by WordPress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A chart included on the plugin&#8217;s details page shows a significant page load time reduction when using the plugin, as compared to sites with translations that don&#8217;t use the plugin. The plugin brings translations very close to the same page load times as English (non-translated) sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1658\" height=\"1200\" data-attachment-id=\"148367\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/performant-translations-plugin-now-available-on-wordpress-org/performant-translations\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations.png\" data-orig-size=\"1658,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"performant-translations\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations-300x217.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations-500x362.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148367\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations.png 1658w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations-300x217.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations-500x362.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations-768x556.png 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations-1536x1112.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1658px) 100vw, 1658px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With enough testing and feedback, we hope to eventually merge this plugin into WordPress core,&#8221; Performance Team contributor Pascal Birchler said when announcing the plugin on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the coming weeks and months we will share more testing instructions and continue to improve the plugin. This will be made available via Performance Lab, too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who are testing the plugin can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/performant-translations/#new-topic-0\">report issues on the support forum</a> or create an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy/performant-translations\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performant Translations is considered to be a beta testing plugin but can be tested and used in production at your own risk. It doesn&#8217;t require any changes to settings or configuration after installation. The plugin can be safely removed after testing, because it essentially cleans up after itself. All <code>.php</code> files it generates will be removed by the server once the plugin is deactivated and uninstalled. </p>\n",

      "slug": "wordpress-com-launches-100-year-domain-and-hosting-plan-for-38k",
      "content": "\n<p>WordPress.com is now selling a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/100-year/\">100-year plan</a>, one of the longest available in the industry, for a one-time payment of $38,000. It includes managed WordPress hosting (whatever that looks like in 100 years), multiple backups across geographically distributed data centers, submission to the Internet Archive if the site is public, 24/7 dedicated support, and a domain that doesn&#8217;t need to be renewed by the customer for a century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, limits domain registration to a maximum of 10 years. Auto-renewing after this time requires the customer to renew on time and keep their payment method updated. A 100-year plan removes these uncertainties but still hinges on the registrar staying in business into the next century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who buy into the plan will need to have superior confidence in WordPress.com, coupled with the belief that domain names will still be important to the fundamental architecture of the web decades from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on the difficulties in pricing the 100-year plan during his presentation at WordCamp US 2023, while simultaneously discouraging WordPress product owners from offering lifetime licenses. The distinction here is that the 100-year plan has a finite length of time, even if its future support seems unfathomable at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It also got me thinking about lifetime licenses, which I think we should stop doing in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve ever worked with an accountant or an acquirer they don&#8217;t like when you have those because it&#8217;s essentially an open ended commitment, including often with support. How do you recognize that revenue? Offer a 20 year plan or something. I think when you&#8217;re saying &#8216;lifetime,&#8217; it sort of cheapens the word. If we&#8217;re really thinking long-term, what promises we&#8217;re making to our customers, I think we should re-examine those practices.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://longnow.org/\">Long Now Foundation</a>, a non-profit established to foster long term thinking. The organization&#8217;s first project is the &#8220;Clock of the Long Now,&#8221; a mechanical monument designed to keep accurate time for the next 10,000 years:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It is still being assembled deep inside a mountain in west Texas. The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.</p>\n<cite><a href=\"https://longnow.org/\">The Long Now website</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com is building something parallel to this in the digital world, enabling people to create their own virtual, lasting monuments and preserve their homes on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embedded in the new offering is also a poignant reminder that WordPress.com is a domain registrar, as the company recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-a-bid-for-google-domains-customers-offering-1-million-free-transfers\">made a bid to capture Google Domain customers</a> ahead of their domains being sold off to Squarespace. Even if the new 100-year hosting plan is too expensive for 99.9% of prospective customers, it gives the impression that the company is capable of hosting entrusted domains for the long term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody, not even WordPress.com, knows what that will look like in 50 years, but it&#8217;s an ambitious, thought-provoking offering. What resources will a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) point to 50 years from now? Or will URLs be discarded into the scrap pile of obsolete building blocks as soon as there&#8217;s a better, more efficient way to identify web addresses? What does longevity look like in the digital world?</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>WordCamp US concluded this weekend after gathering nearly 2,000 attendees in National Harbor, Maryland, for the Community Summit, Contributor Day, and main conference days. For the majority of people in the WordPress world who were unable to attend, the recordings of the presentations from project leadership will give you an idea of what to expect in the near future and beyond. These videos were <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/the-future-of-wordpress-whats-next-for-gutenberg/\">published</a> right away and are embedded below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomposy spoke on &#8220;The Future of WordPress,&#8221; with an emphasis on how the project can continue to thrive, build resilience, and outlast its current contributors. She encouraged the community to be proactive about expanding their learning and connections. She also reaffirmed the importance of the project&#8217;s mission to democratize publishing and the impact that can have in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:19px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3OaypzgzAlw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg capped off the event with a presentation titled &#8220;What&#8217;s Next for Gutenberg,&#8221; followed by a Q&amp;A. He highlighted a few features coming in 6.4, including font management, an image lightbox, and the new Twenty Twenty Four default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress is moving into the Collaboration phase of the Gutenberg project, which will enable multiple authors to edit simultaneously, Mullenweg highlighted the importance of redesigning the admin. This will be the first major redesign since MP6 and is also aimed at improving workflows for administrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg announced that WordPress has launched a new LMS (Learning Management System) working group. He commented on the benefits and drawbacks of having multiple plugins in the ecosystem that do the same thing. Although the competition can encourage more innovation, it can also lock users into one solution if they aren&#8217;t built to be interoperable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representatives from Tutor LMS, Learndash, LifterLMS, and Sensei met to discuss using common data models so users can easily switch between solutions. They are working in a new #LMS slack channel to establish industry standards that will preserve user freedom and choice through practical interoperability changes to their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also said he would like to see more plugins, such as those handling SEO or site builders, to agree on some data models so that products can operate in a more standardized and performant way, serving users better in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the presentation below, along with the Q&amp;A that followed. There were more than 80 questions submitted, and those that were missed during Q&amp;A will have answers published to in a future post on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EavRd7PtA0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fa0Q-brSeI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n",

      "slug": "post-status-celebrates-10-years-adds-joost-de-valk-and-marieke-van-de-rakt-as-partners",
      "content": "\n<p>This year <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a> is celebrating a decade of serving WordPress professionals with its member-supported community. The site was founded by Brian Krogsgard in 2013, and now runs an active Slack community with 2,083 members, a weekly newsletter with 4,300 subscribers, and a job board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a testament to the community&#8217;s continued growth, Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/joost-and-marieke-join-post-status-as-equity-partners/\">announced</a> it has added WordPress veterans Joost de Valk and Marieke van de Rakt as equity partners who have invested cash in the business. They will also be taking on active roles in leading the Post Status community &#8211; de Valk as CTO and van de Rakt as an advisor and editorial contributor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Post Status has created the most important networking possibilities for us in the past and helped us grow our WordPress businesses,&#8221; van de Rakt said. &#8220;It seems only fit to contribute and to take on an active role in the Post Status community at this point.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post Status CEO Cory Miller said the organization will be moving forward with &#8220;the same vision and values &#8211; supporting the business of WordPress, with an emphasis on agency owners.&#8221; Co-owner Lindsey Miller will be taking on a new role as CMO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although maintaining the professional community remains their first priority, Post Status will be expanding with two new initiatives this year that will benefit both partners and members. The team has soft launched the new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://poststatus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">poststatus.com</a>, featuring a new <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-companies/\">Partner Directory</a> that showcases WordPress businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I believe a healthy growing business ecosystem inside of WordPress is absolutely key to WP continued growth and success,&#8221; Cory Miller said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We want to get a little more organized, professional as an industry, and that means cooperating, communicating, working together, with Post Status being that collective brand, showcasing the agencies, software and professionals of WordPress better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The next step is our directory. We want to say, here’s our professional industry for those looking at WordPress for their web projects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to ramping up editorial commentary and analysis on industry trends, with the depth of expertise of new partners de Valk and van de Rakt, Post Status is in the early stages of planning an annual summit. It will be similar to WordPress&#8217; contributor summit but for businesses and individuals who are making their way in the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The second step is to gather together, talk business and what are we seeing, what are the issues, challenges, and opportunities as an industry,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;That naturally gives us focus and initiatives to cooperate on together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most industries have this already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Doctors, lawyers, big businesses have these kinds of venues and platforms for conversations about the state of their industry. We need that for WordPress and Post Status is taking next steps to do so.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two initiatives are next on the organization&#8217;s roadmap, and with the new partnership they now have the resources to execute on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Showcase the collective, that’s our directory,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;And gather us together to have the key conversations we need about where we’re going as an industry and community. That’s our summit.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsors are what keeps the lights on at Post Status. The organization has historically been focused on driving individual membership for WordPress professionals but is shifting its focus on businesses as members now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We want every WP pro in Post Status, this is their home, their trade association,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Those who work at WP companies or with WP as part of their gig, we always want to welcome them in to PS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post Status is one of the few WordPress organizations that has been operating for longer than a decade. Now that the Pressnomics event has been retired for four years, the WordPress community is sorely in need of an event where the business-focused community can connect and help each other grow WordPress&#8217; success in the wider industry. Post Status is the organization best-suited to step into this role. To stay on top of the their efforts and plans and to support the business community, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/join/\">join as a member</a> and/or <a href=\"https://poststatus.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ff3456b27ebe0be0155087894&amp;id=afc03177a6\">subscribe to the weekly newsletter.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The theme&#8217;s project leaders unveiled the designs and concept for Twenty Twenty-Four in an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">announcement</a> on WordPress.org today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who have complained that past default themes have been too niche or too narrowly focused in design, this theme will take the reverse approach. Contributors are attempting to build the ultimate multi-purpose theme that can be used for nearly any kind of website, highlighting the unmatched flexibility of building with blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:21px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-attachment-id=\"148180\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-unveils-design-for-upcoming-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme/tt4\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TT4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-300x200.jpeg\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-500x333.jpeg\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148180\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4.jpeg 1600w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Four</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea behind Twenty Twenty-Four is to make a default theme that can be used on any type of site, with any topic,&#8221; core contributorJessica Lyschik said. &#8220;Because of that, and contrary to past years, it has no single topic. Instead, three use cases were explored: one more tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, one tailored for photographers and artists and one specifically tailored for writers and bloggers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year&#8217;s default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">Twenty Twenty-Three</a>, was a stripped-back and minimal version of Twenty Twenty-Two, with a strong focus on community-submitted style variations. Like its predecessor, Twenty Twenty-Four will put the spotlight on some of the latest WordPress design features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Twenty Twenty-Four will be a block theme fully compatible with all the site editor tooling and it will surface new design tools like the details block or vertical text,&#8221; Lyschik said. &#8220;Another key intent for the theme is to properly present whole page patterns and template variations so that users don’t need to assemble whole pages themselves, thus easing up their site building process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:21px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"840\" data-attachment-id=\"148184\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-unveils-design-for-upcoming-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme/tt4-full-page-designs\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1600,840\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TT4-full-page-designs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs-300x158.jpeg\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs-500x263.jpeg\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148184\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs.jpeg 1600w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs-500x263.jpeg 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs-1536x806.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whole page patterns are a critical feature that all of the best block themes provide, as most people feel daunted when starting from a blank slate. If a whole page pattern is already pre-inserted on a new website install, users are light years ahead in their site building efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Four features the Cardo font for headings and a sans-serif system font for paragraph text. Cardo is an Old Style serif typeface designed by David J. Perry in 2002 for “classicists, biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists.” It grounds the design with a bit of sophistication but should be easy to swap out with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-roadmap-includes-typography-management-features-new-blocks-and-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme\">typography management features coming in 6.4</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial previews of the theme don&#8217;t stray far from many of the traditional website designs you might see browsing businesses or portfolios. It leans more towards  providing an invisible framework for the user&#8217;s own creations, instead of pushing a single, opinionated design. This design lets the Site Editor and design controls shine as tools that can unlock human creativity on the screen. So far it has received positive feedback on the WordPress.org announcement.

Until recently, Lahaina was home to Organic Themes co-founder David Morgan, who hosted the Maui WordPress meetups for years, and co-organized WordCamp Maui in 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morgan and his co-founder Jeff Milone have been best friends since high school. In 2007, Morgan sold everything and moved to Oahu, working as a freelance designer while living out of his car after arriving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While living on Oahu, Jeff and I began working long-distance on freelance WordPress projects,&#8221; Morgan said. &#8220;This led to the idea of starting a theme business together, and I invited Jeff to Hawaii in 2009. While he was visiting me on Oahu, we flew to Maui and fell in love with the island.

      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/3.0.0\">WordPressCS 3.0.0</a> was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/21/wordpresscs-3-0-0-is-now-available/\">released</a> this week with what its maintainer, Juliette Reinders Folmer, says are significant changes to improve the accuracy, performance, stability, and maintainability of all sniffs, and its handling of modern PHP. The project is a collection of <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> rules (sniffs) that are used to validate code developed for WordPress, helping developers meet the requirements of the official <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/\">WordPress Coding Standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update adds many of the non-controversial rules <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/20/updating-the-coding-standards-for-modern-php/\">proposed in March 2020</a> to the Coding standards guidelines but leaves those that generated more discussion or objections for a future release. Many of the new rules are now available as sniffs in WordPressCS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 3.0.0 includes important architecture changes. Most notably, Composer is now the only supported way to install WordPressCS, as this update includes four run-time dependencies. The release contains breaking changes for those using ignore annotations and those who maintain custom rulesets or have created a custom PHPCS standard based on the project. A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/wiki/Upgrade-Guide-to-WordPressCS-3.0.0-for-Developers-of-external-standards\">detailed upgrade guide</a> is available for these various scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPressCS is largely maintained by Folmer and a small group of volunteers, but the future of the project is in jeopardy if they cannot get funding. Folmer said it is currently in a good place with this release but this will not last long with the pace at which PHP is moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPressCS 3.0.0 has cost thousands of hours of work and the vast majority of work has been done by one, mostly unpaid, contributor, with code review support from two fellow maintainers,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unless funding is found to continue maintaining WordPressCS and its dependencies, the future is bleak and maintenance will be halted.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folmer is calling on corporation and agency users of WordPressCS to find a way to fund the project&#8217;s continued maintenance and development. She elaborated on the dire need to have more contributors involved:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>If we are being realistic, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\">bus factor</a>&nbsp;of WordPressCS is&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>, which is the most dangerous situation for any project to be in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of the WordPress community, including WordPress Core, relies heavily on the WordPress Coding Standards for code quality and security checks and while the community has been pretty vocal with copious complaints about the delayed release, barely anyone has stepped up and actually contributed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of the work for WordPressCS requires specialized knowledge. Knowledge which can be learned with enough time investment, but in recent years nobody has stepped up to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This is an unsustainable situation and it ends now</em></strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPressCS has become one of the most highly used open source tools in the WordPress ecosystem that is now in a vulnerable place with so few contributors. Although many developers commented on the release, thanking Folmer for her efforts, no contributors or corporations have publicly stepped forward to support the project&#8217;s continued develpment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With over 15 million installations on Packagist and a 400% increase in monthly installation in the past three years alone, WPCS’s popularity is surging and shows no sign of stopping,&#8221; Lucas Bustamante, a backend developer specialized in automated tests, commented on the post. &#8220;The situation is alarming as WPCS is a foundational tool that flags not only code style issues but also critical security issues, making WordPress a more secure CMS. Letting WPCS fall into limbo poses a risk to the entire WordPress ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\n",

It&#8217;s a neat little shortcut for launching a Playground instance without having to remember the URL or get the plugin/theme&#8217;s slug to append to it. The video below shows a site created with a selected plugin installed in under 20 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:19px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video autoplay controls src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/playground-chrome-extension.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have been using Playground internally a lot for testing out plugins, and quick demos for internal or client meetings,&#8221; LUBUS founder Ajit Bohra said. &#8220;We often find a plugin or theme which we would like to test drive. It involves copying the slug of the theme or plugin and using them in the URL. To make this quick we thought of building and quick browser extension to add a button on wordpress.org to quickly launch a plugin or theme in the Playground.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohra posted his process of creating the extension in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajitbohra/status/1692408702962393256\">thread</a> on X. He used the <a href=\"https://www.plasmo.com/\">Plasmo framework</a>, which offers a dedicated runtime for building browser extensions, taking the project from idea to built in approximately 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For POC code wise all we need to get the required button on the plugin page. <a href=\"https://t.co/2lEV2H4q0K\">pic.twitter.com/2lEV2H4q0K</a></p>&mdash; Ajit Bohra (@ajitbohra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajitbohra/status/1692415787791958085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohra said the browser extension is currently a proof of concept that he would like to further extend with more settings based on feedback from users. He also hopes to collaborate with the Meta team in the future to see something like this added to the plugin and theme pages on WordPress.org so that users don&#8217;t have to rely on a browser extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chrome extension is called &#8220;<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-wordpress-playgro/khfpfafeepbfdhggfoalfmbhkmjkolmo/related\">Open in WordPress Playground</a>&#8221; and is available to the public for free on the Chrome Web Store.

The feature was <a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/nasa-funds-development-of-front-end-highlighting-feature-for-equalize-digital-accessibility-checker/\">funded</a> by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), through Equalize Digital&#8217;s consulting work on the new NASA websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA recently launched the <a href=\"https://beta.nasa.gov/\">beta version</a> of its WordPress-powered flagship site, which WordCamp US attendees may hear about next week during the team&#8217;s sessions, including Friday&#8217;s keynote address: <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/session/friday-keynote/\">For All Userkind: NASA Web Modernization and WordPress</a> and another presentation titled <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/session/hands-on-with-nasas-new-digital-platform/\">Hands on with NASA’s new digital platform.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equalize Digital was contracted to perform accessibility testing, user testing with screen reader users, and provide accessibility governance recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of the contract for those services, they also contracted us to develop this feature for the plugin,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. &#8220;They have an enterprise license but we decided in collaboration with them that we would make it a feature in the free plugin so everyone could benefit, not a paid-only feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They were actually really interested in that because it&#8217;s part of their mission to give back to humanity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to developing the frontend highlighting feature, the accessibility checker plugin only had reports inside the post edit screen, with output that is nearly indecipherable for less technical users who are not accustomed to reading HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1493\" height=\"709\" data-attachment-id=\"147988\" data-permalink=\"https://wptavern.com/equalize-digital-accessibility-checker-plugin-adds-new-frontend-highlighting-feature-funded-by-nasa/screenshot-3-3\" data-orig-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3.png\" data-orig-size=\"1493,709\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"screenshot-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3-300x142.png\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3-500x237.png\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147988\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3.png 1493w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3-300x142.png 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3-500x237.png 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3-768x365.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1493px) 100vw, 1493px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new frontend highlighting feature makes the accessibility report&#8217;s output far more approachable for users who may not be developers.

We want to make building websites that work for people with disabilities standard practice and were excited to work with NASA to make accessibility testing reports easier for non-developers to understand and take action on. Adding this feature to the free plugin was a no-brainer for us. We’re looking forward to seeing more WordPress website owners finding and fixing accessibility problems on their websites.”</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>This year&#8217;s WordCamp US includes a Community Summit, an invitation-only contributor-focused event that will take place prior to the main conference on August 22-23, 2023, in National Harbor, Washington, DC. It will be the first summit in six years, since the last one was held in Paris, France in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the summit has offered contributors the rare opportunity to hold in-person discussions on important topics across teams. In order to ensure the gathering is diverse and inclusive, previous community summit organizers have included a travel assistance program to remove the financial barriers of attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Community Summit travel fund is <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/about-the-community-summit-travel-fund/\">providing $48,000 in travel assistance</a>, thanks to a group of sponsors that includes Automattic, A2 Hosting, Elementor, and Weglot. The funding will support 38 attendees with roundtrip transportation ($31K for 24 people) and hotel stays ($16,500 for 66 hotel nights for 22 people).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attendees have been reminded about the <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/non-attribution/\">non-attribution guideline</a> which enables the event to offer a safe and inclusive environment for collaboration where comments are not attributed to specific individuals. Discussions, photographs, recaps, and summaries can be shared as long as they abide by the non-attribution guideline. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/schedule/\">schedule</a> has been published, featuring 26 discussion topics. Contributors will have dedicated sessions to discuss the criteria for delaying the upgrade of foundational tech, understanding contributor leadership roles, refining Five for the Future for a robust WordPress community, accessibility in the WordPress project, open source participation in global legislation, backwards compatibility in Gutenberg, among other interesting topics that lend themselves to cross-team collaboration.</p>\n",
